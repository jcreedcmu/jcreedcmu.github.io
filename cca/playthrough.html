<p>The summer palace is nestled in a cosy valley in Rakanayak. Frej descends the central stairs with considerable anticipation: the will is read today. They are the last to arrive. Their younger sibling Ev is already here, visibly bored and impatient. Neither knew their mother well. Uus and El spent so much time raising them they might as well have been their parents.</p>
<p>Their mother was styled 12 Taadiadi, the twelfth monarch of the state of juta-arkeny-and-miscellaneous-territories-and-colonies to call themselves "the increaser". Unlike the previous eleven, it is hard to point to what she increased. Certainly not the national territory. Himenepit seemed more ready to secede than ever. No wars had been fought since the previous monarch.</p>
<p>Perhaps its debts had increased.</p>
<p>Frej thought they were prepared for this moment. Tutors, essays, research, study, training. The ceremony proceeds. Frej finds themself distracted. The sounds of the incantations and set phrases are muddled by their inattention. The moment comes when the name is declared.</p>
<p>It is Ev's. Ev! Frej looks in their direction. The two are not stood together, but rather at quite a distance. Not so far apart that a facial expression cannot be read perfectly.</p>

<p>There is a modest farm on the island of Himenepit, and its owner is Snorri, third-oldest of ten children. Its basement-pantry contains enough food for probably two years, if not three: fruit preserves, fermented wortel, yellow radishes, cabbage, spinach, beets, and onion, various grains, potatoes. But its bookshelves contain even better sustenance: books on law, history, romances, fantasies, and above all else poetry.</p>
<p>Snorri is sitting on the porch, reading a newspaper. In local news, the provincial legislative election is in only eight weeks. Somewhat of a farce since there's only two monarch-approved parties. The newspaper has some fluff pieces about the candidates. Snorri turns the page to the National section.</p>
<p>12 Taadiadi has died! There hasn't been a change of monarch for decades. He was barely a child when it happened last.
Snorri considers what this could mean for him and the vague plans he's been turning over in his head for the last few years. He...</p>

a red silk suit. It fits perfectly. (How could that be? Was it already
tailored before today? If so, how was it known...?)</p>
<p>The naming ceremony goes well. Ev succeeds at containing their

deference-to-the-past at the right moments, as you coached them to in
the painfully small amount of time available. You're proud of them.
They are now — and will be for the rest of their life — the
monarch 5 Taprekkut, temporal embodiment of the eternal state of
juta-arkeny, etc. etc. Maybe they will get around to actually doing
some real proper Restoring. Arkeny could use it.</p>

dropped, and find a moment when it is possible to get Ev's attention

Demonstrating that she's willing to do the work herself, that she's

anything less.</p>

<p>The basement of Circle Books is packed. People stand by the walls, sit
on the stairsteps. The few copies of your books that were for sale
here have already sold out. Snorri chats a little while with Aeia before
the show starts. The two of you are acquainted with one another; you'd met
during a previous reading at  Circle a few years ago, and once at a
publisher's conference. </p>
<p>The lectern <em>is</em> a bit dusty, but Snorri jokes that it gives the scene a suitably professorial ambience.</p>
<p>He first does a couple of the old hits: "don't leave a pair of shoes
outside together, or a hygrakym will grow out of them and run away",
and his translation of Kladimny's "what is a ghost?"</p>
<p>Snorri's newest work is titled "departure": the imagery is from the
experience of travel, wandering, being lost; it lingers on infinite
cycles of repetition, and things that break these cycles; it meditates on
the rise and fall of nations for trivial and unpredictable reasons, machinery
breaking down, losing parts; it ends with a song to regrowth amid collapse.</p>
<p>The reaction is mixed, but strong. There is earnest applause from the
front rows, but a curiously negative reaction from the back of the
room. They don't jeer, but they look very angry. The displeasure
started midway through "departure", during a passage that delivered an
emotional question mark about the the smashing of the wall of the
Serkaioba Garden two hundred years ago.</p>
<p>Both of you notice, with shock, that one of the attendees pulls a
length of metal pipe from his jacket. Immediately, another patron
notices it and tries to wrest it away from him.</p>

<p>Snorri approaches the heckler first. The pipe thankfully misses his head, but a fist connects with the side of his head. Aeia body-checks him, and he loses grip on the pipe in the middle of a second swing, and it goes flying — and makes a sort of <em>chonk</em> sound as it embeds itself strangely into the wall of the basement.

<p>But Uldon is asleep for now, victim of an overpowering late afternoon nap. You're temporarily unsupervised. There are noises from the street. Two people politely arguing. Their voices sound sort of like dad and mum's friends. You cross the house to a window facing where the noise is coming from, and you see a car drive off, and a grown-up — but not a very old one — go into the empty house next door.

You do your best to improvise a mortar and pestle with the rounded blunt end of an ivory handle of a fork and a bowl from the kitchen. You trace, onto the concrete slab in front of the door of the house adjacent to yours,  the symbols for "I will return" and the four-fold sign that means "1/16 of a day" with the paste, let it soak in for a minute, and then wash it away with a cup of water.

<p>You retrieve the pipe. Naturally, it's quite dark behind the hole, but there does seem to be a significant amount of empty space, more than could be explained by the pipe's intrusion itself.</p>
<p>The first aid kit is in a closet behind the shelf that houses the northern philosophy section, which is now horizontal. Thankfully it's not too tall a shelf. You manage to right it, and clear access to the closet, although a lot of its books are scattered across the floor. You drop the first aid kit in the general vicinity of Snorri. He seems busy whipping himself up again into a rather emotional state yelling back at the intruder. Understandable. You keep the pipe in your hand as you try to stare its previous owner down, but he ignores you.</p>

<p>Garnam is indulgent in listening to your explanations, even though, as you would readily concede, they are not in any obvious way directly related to the political crisis at hand, or your personal safety. Nonetheless, it's comforting and grounding to have a conversation about something concrete — a familiar sort of topic from your conversations with Ev over the years of growing up.</p>
<p>There is in fact a natural segue from your criticism of Rudtanay getting, a ha, well, I think you'll find, not just a few facts wrong about winter chemotaxis in beetles specifically — to Garnam leaping into a rant of her own about his description of the Medrut. For one thing, she says, that name is insulting: it is only used by (a) those who resent the monarchy, (b) those who are ignorant and unknowingly imitate the language of the former, and (c) certain groups in the modern world who fraudulently assume the mantle of defending the monarchy, but who are impostors, and have no royal commission, and who wish only to have an excuse to commit violence.</p>
<p>She says that the name of the group she belongs to is the Bureau of Continuity. You have never heard of it, despite being privy to many of the monarchy's secrets. She notes, apologetically, that you would have been briefed upon assuming the throne if... things had gone differently.</p>
<p>As for your next move, Garnam advises that you spend at least a night or two playing along and staying in Rakanayak while more information is gathered. The fortunate thing is that Josk has high confidence that you are easily intimidated, and will not try to interfere with his coup — so living down to his expectations might be prudent for now. The Bureau has found evidence only for there being one planned nightly checkup that Frej is asleep in the assigned house. She does suggest that she can probably convey, through her associates, a message to Ev.</p>

childhood. (even though you have the original, in the attic, empty)</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it is also empty.</p>
<p>There are carvings on the outside, much like the one in the attic. But
where the ones on the box upstairs were geometric, and abstract, these
seem to be depicting an arken folk-tale, full of the "eachness" that
is so common in that genre; there are the "four sisters" (though two
are brothers) and each has their way of solving problems (through
force and threats, through cunning and deceit, through flattery and
touching, through honesty and haggling) and each has their prop (her
bat, and his disguise, and his perfume, and her headcap) and each has
their best friend from another family with four children, and each has
a color (red, white, green, orange) and so forth.</p>
<p>On the inside of the lid you notice a list of numbers, written in
inkfruit ink, heavily faded. Maybe amounts of money?</p>
<p>You hear a scratching noise somewhere behind some wall.</p>

a) a book at the very bottom of the shelf, revealed, you suppose, by the removal of some of the books in front of it. It has a dark blue cover that seems vertiginously familiar — you can almost smell the smell of it — that of your father's overcoat in his study — you become dizzy.

<p>Garnam has some supplies for altering one's appearance: you had dyed your hair gray, and put on a thin woolen sweater, and red overalls, as well as a pair of eyeglass frames without lenses. The night before you left, the two of you had a long conversation: Garnam discusses (with an amount of candor that seems almost unbefitting a member of a security organization — but then again, given your position, and given the circumstances, you can understand why she has chosen to set ordinary standards aside) her path towards joining the Bureau. You in turn tell her about your frustrations with the decisions the monarchy has made in the past, during your youth and adolescence — your hope that you would be able to turn them around — your disappointment (mixed with pride for Ev!) that you wouldn't be able to after all. You emphasized how grateful you were to Garnam for her help in making you feel less powerless.</p>
<p>The drive to Serkaioba is relatively uneventful, until you get within the reach of the traditional city walls. There is considerable police and other emergency-response activity. You're not sure why. The traffic gets worse the closer you get to  the civic building. You're not intimately familiar with the movement of crowds in cities, but something seems... off.

<p>The question "Who does he think he is, anyway?" has an answer: more
precisely, it <em>had</em> an answer.</p>
<p>He thought he was Josk, the architect of a subtle revolution wrought
by him and certain collaborators that had patiently worked towards the
goal of controlling the Arken monarchy for almost twenty years,
without any public knowledge, without any disruption, without any
complications.</p>
<p>But he is dead on the floor of a pub in Serkaioba, and so are you,
both stabbed by a poisoned knife at various times during the
struggle, during which one other bystander who tried to intervene
received a concussion, but fortunately was not cut.</p>
<p>He had intended to accomplish this transaction correctly by doing it
himself — he trusted himself, far more than the other parties that
he worked with, which were easily persuaded by favors. Josk assumed,
incorrectly, that you would be as well.</p>

<p>Because of the incident a few days ago, the police were already
keeping tabs on you and the shop. Officer Grosje noticed the pipe
embedded in the wall, and had planted a small microphone behind some
nearby encyclopedias. Because of this he was aware that activity was
taking place in the basement. He had requested a tap on the phone
lines of both the restaurant on the west side of Circle Books, (the
direction that the tunnel led) as well as the small grocery to the
east, since it required no extra paperwork.</p>
<p>This proved extremely convenient for officer Grosje, for it solved a
mystery Grosje had been pursuing for some months: where the Yumostev
(who were to believed to derive most of their profit from stolen art,
books, and rarities) kept their goods while awaiting a buyer.</p>
<p>After the shouting and screaming had finished, after the two Yumostev
members in pursuit of you had completely demolished one bookshelf
which had been almost securely wedged in place by the second that you
toppled, after Grosje, with backup in tow, caught them by surprise
with a tremendous advantage in weaponry — Grosje thanked you for
recovering the majority of the books, and set about taking them into
police possession.</p>
<p>It was unfortunate for him that he was unable to enjoy very much of
the (quite considerable) bribe that he received upon returning the
books to the private collector from whom they were stolen. While
apparently drunk, he fell over the railing of a 9th floor hotel room
balcony.</p>
<p>Why he was in a hotel room at all, in the city he lived in for his
entire life, was not entirely clear.</p>
<hr>
<p>But before that — after officer Grosje thanked you for recovering
the books, after he had taken them all away, after he left, after the
restaurant was shuttered and blocked off by police barricades — you
finally had a moment of solitude and stillness. You went downstairs,
opened the supply closet, opened the box labelled "tax forms, year
3187", and removed the book with the dark blue cover, which you had
put away there in those panicked moments, desperately wanting to keep
this book safe separate from all the others.</p>
<p>The writing in it is your father's writing. The drawings are,
certainly, your father's drawings. It says nothing of his hidden
failure to manage the bookstore. It says nothing of the bank loans. It
says nothing of the other loans he obtained when the banks stopped
lending. It says nothing of the things he did to keep those loans from
coming due.</p>
<p>It is instead full of mundane and pleasant afternoons and days and
evenings: it speaks of dinners with aunts and cousins, and
conversations about school, and summer days spent in serkaioba gardens
with his daughter.</p>

<p>First: at the perimeter of the park, dozens of police are slowly replacing barricades in closer and closer perimeters to where you and your audience are. They have guns, although you're not sure whether they are supplied with lethal or nonlethal ammunition — serkaioba security forces often prefer to inflict suffering rather than death.</p>
<p>Second: inside the current position of the perimeter, but at some distance off, a person of indeterminate age. They are wearing red clothing and glasses, and their hair is grey — but their face is that of a young adult. Their demeanor is calm and assured. They are approaching you, not quickly, but they will probably arrive within thirty seconds if nothing deters them from their path.</p>
<p>Third: the sky, near the horizon, to the south, looks wrong. It shimmers, and is the wrong shade of blue.</p>

<p>From the hotel, before checking out, just before sunrise, you leave a message on the answering machine of the ketigenic climate forecasting department. There is a certain amount of Hello! Hello. This is Rossum, you may remember me from our earlier meeting, terribly sorry to call you so early in the morning etc. etc. before you hand the receiver to the students, who take turns explaining each in their own way how they think their calculations were wrong, and how it is urgent that serkaioba and neighboring suburbs prepare for dangerous ocean swell as well as widespread cognitive effects.</p>
<p>The streets in the central historical district of Soffa are narrow and chaotic. In here, says the driver of the (probably off-the-books) private taxi van, they aren't numbered, nor named in any sensible fashion, or indexed from a central street or point of origin, or named after registered city blocks. Instead, each alley, path, and shortcut has a handful of different ways of referring to it depending on context. The one you are passing through right now is Light Through the Trees, but it is also (in summer) Mangoes Are Sold Here, and The Fucking Awful Smell, and (if you're talking to someone of an older generation) Where The Ninestone Family Bank Used To Be, Before It Failed, Like All We Saw Coming.</p>
<p>The fuel station is at the end of this street, in the center of a jumbled plaza, in the shape of a polygon you lack a name for. You try to count how many sides it has, but you seem to come up with a different number each time you count. You all pile out of the taxi, and it idles, the fare clock still running.</p>
<p>Yodr confidently slips between standard Arken and Penger dialect negotiating with the proprietor. She feigns a level of dismay bordering on aggravated. At the price, maybe? At the rationed quantity being offered? You can't even make out half of the words in the sentences being exchange. At the last minute, her face switches to satisfied and she slaps the owner on the back. He grumbles and shuffles into the back room of the station.</p>
<p>But before he can emerge, the sky...
breaks.</p>
<p>The calculations were wrong. </p>
<p>The sky is entirely red. It is red with green streaks. It is white, it is shimmering, it is a night sky full of stars, clouds, galaxies, entities that seem to be alive and moving;</p>
<p>It is infinitely far away. It presses against your face. It has, at its zenith, a hole in it. The hole (you are certain) looks at you: regards you with a chilling indifference. The hole closes like a mouth, and opens, vomiting something;</p>
<p>out of the hole comes, somehow, more space, more sky, more stars, more daylight, more moons, crowding out the red and sunset pink and noon blue, and the horizon skitters away from the explosion, and all is sky. The ground is missing. You are not sure where you are standing. The students have disappeared, and the fuel station is gone, and Soffa is swallowed up in chaos.</p>
<p>And then it is over. Nothing is unusual. The owner emerges with a disgusting looking can full of horrible smelling gunk, and Yodr — after catching her breath, for she and the other students apparently just experienced the same thing you did — exchanges a handful of cash for it.</p>
<p>Here, in the exact center of a chromatic ekro, a wonder of the southern sea, bearing a strength that has not been seen in several centuries, there is actually very little risk of physical or permanent psychological harm: it is miles and miles away, at the cell boundaries, where there is great danger.</p>
<p>But you have, in the course of an unlikely and somewhat accidental adventure, done all you could to experience that which has been rarely experienced, and — perhaps — to help others avoid harm.</p>

<p>You turn around in your steps abruptly, abandoning any interest in what's going on here. Your level of panic remains manageable — mild, even — for almost three minutes.</p>
<p>It rises considerably when the police begin closing in, shouting through megaphones. Loud cracks echo off the city buildings. You know you should be frightened at the gunshots, but it's the claustrophobic feeling of being surrounded by anonymous figures that's getting under your skin. You can't find any break in the police line across open ground.</p>
<p>But then — you spot a motion in the dense woods, off the park paths. You walk toward it. Is that Garnam? At the same time — you sense someone is following you, but you're unable to focus on anything other than the hope of a familiar face. Your walk becomes a hard run. Your lungs hurt. You reach her and the relief visible on her face is more palpable even than your own. The sound of shouting and gunfire is louder than before.</p>
<p>An embrace. Garnam says she has three pieces of information for you.</p>
<p>One: that Josk has died, although the cause is still unknown. The palace has become chaotic. Josk's allies are fighting over who will be his successor. Ev overheard a conversation in which they were referred to as "that idiot" and realized that they were being manipulated. Ev composed a long and ornate message of apology to you — and although the physical document was intercepted and destroyed by someone in Josk's faction, members of the bureau managed to inform Ev that it was appropriate to act unconcerned that there was no immediate response. Garnam does her best at describing the contents of the letter to you. Even through the murky glass of several intermediary's paraphrasing and summarization, you can tell it is a message in Ev's own voice; Ev's overthinking; Ev's earnestness. It is a comfort.</p>
<p>Two: that Utlimaja, principle of Serkaioba province, whom you were trying to contact, has somehow also died, presumably in some act related to the present unrest. As Garnam is beginning to discuss the detailed consequences of this surprise, the two of you are interrupted by the sound of a person passing through dry leaves and tree branches.</p>
<p>He emerges from the same path the two of you took into the woods, smiling, calm, hands out, palms up. He speaks, and you recognize immediately from the first line what he is reciting and permit him to continue:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>Holy is the world that brings a meal to a cold soul
Cruel the world that delivers
  one innocent creature
  into the mouth of another

Rain falls on the broad, soft leaves covering the house,
Their skin becoming wet,
Possessing a saintly indifference to the weather.

An unvanquishable strength,
even as the leaves foresee their own end:
they dry and crumble on a distant day,
and are replaced by their cousins.

Tskani knows a melody suitable for leaves, a spell that has no effect.

  O leaves, O trees, communicate to me your thoughts.
  You will never speak like I do.
  You will never know ignorance.
</code></pre></div>
<p>This strange moment — this unexpected introduction — this is what you remember most from the turbulence that is the next several months. Even more so than the hours in the hidden zemej-lined bunker that Garnam guides the three of you into, safe from the storm that somehow she has received warning of — even more than the the return to the palace, and your reconciliation with Ev — the speeches by the various members of the Bureau that you and Ev formally met for the first time — the tense planning meetings — the trials.</p>
<p>But now things have settled. You, Frej, are the head of the Bureau of Continuity, and you, Snorri, are the principal of Serkaioba province; first by appointment, and then by re-election. Frej never learned what the third piece of information was that Garnam was about to give when she was interrupted, but it is no grave concern: now is the time to rebuild.</p>
