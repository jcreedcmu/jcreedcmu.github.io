<h1>Concurrent Choice Adventure</h1>
I wanted to run something like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabletop_role-playing_game">ttrpg</a> but
I wanted it to be the case that
<ul>
<li> It could be played entirely online.
<li> It wasn't a big deal if players wanted to float in or out of the game over time.
<li> Nobody needed to set aside a specific period of time every week to play.
<li> It would be ok if one player wanted to invest a lot of time, and another player less.
<li> The amount of effort required for me, the GM would be fairly small
<li> The amount of effort required players would be <i>very</i> small
<li> The general flavor of the game would be very "rules-light"
</ul>

So I definitely took some inspiration from
"<a href="https://www.secretsofthebarrowmaze.com/what-is-a-west-marches-campaign/">West
Marches</a>" style DnD campaigns, but I wanted to go hard in the direction
of minimizing how much effort it took to be a player. Also <a href="https://lamemage.com/microscope/">Microscope</a> was probably
the source of the idea of question-answering as an end-condition.
We used <a href="https://zulip.com/">Zulip</a> as the online-chat/forum software to conduct the game on,
but probably discord or slack or phpBB or anything even remotely similar could have worked.

<h2>An Example Playthrough</h2>

<a href="playthrough.html">Here's the result of playing through a game</a>, (Mar-Jun 2023) with Chris
Martens, William Lovas, Taus, and more.

<h2>The Rules</h2>

Here's a summary of the rules that we settled on.

<h3>Character Creation</h3>
To make a character, a player gives the GM a <b>name</b> for the
character, their <b>motivating question</b>. For example, something like:

<ul>
<li>    My character's name is "Saliandra" and my question is "how can I
    possibly graduate magic-school when my grades are so terrible?"

<li>    My character's name is "Thrim" and my question is "who murdered my
    grandfather?"

<li>    My character's name is "Jenny" and my question is "will my business
    succeed or fail?"

<li>    My character's name is "Pat" and my question is "will my sister
    forgive me?"
</ul>

That character is now active in the game. They exit the game when the
<ul>
<li> GM judges that their <b>motivating question</b> has been answered, or
<li> that their storyline has otherwise resolved, or
<li> the player decides they want to stop playing
</ul>

<h3>The Game Loop</h3>

The game alternates between two steps, for each character.

<ul>
<li>The <b>GM describes</b> a player character's location, environment, recent experiences, and
presents the player with a handful of choices for what their character does (or tries to do) next, typically around 3-5 options.
The time scale of these choices could be anything from a few seconds to days to years, depending on the story being told.
For example:
<blockquote>
You wake up in a bed in an unfamiliar room. There is a glass of what seems to be water on a table by the bed,
and a television. You <br>
[1] ...drink the water.<br>
[2] ...turn on the television.<br>
[3] ...stay in bed for a while.<br>
[4] ...leave the room.
</blockquote>
<li> The <b>player makes a choice</b>. It can be as simple as stating one of the numbers the GM provided.
Or it can be something more nuanced or complex, like
<blockquote>
1, but I take just the tiniest sip to see if it tastes funny
</blockquote>
or
<blockquote>
2 then 3
</blockquote>
The player should feel free to add more detail about their characters intentions if they want,
but a bare simple choice of one of the options given by the GM is always ok.
</ul>

All of these choices are happening concurrently for all players in the game. At any one time, some
players may be in the state of having made a choice waiting for the GM to resolve what happens,
and others may have not yet responded to the GM's latest choice. The GM should probably
make some reasonable effort to promptly respond to player choices as they're made, but players
need not respond on any fixed schedule.

<h3>Player Interactions</h3>

Sometimes characters wind up in the same location in the game world.
In this case the GM can present choices to both characters jointly,
and wait until all characters in the scene have made some choice
before resolving what results. I found that this is a little more
difficult to manage narratively, but worked ok with a short-lived
dramatic event, after which the characters went their separate ways.
