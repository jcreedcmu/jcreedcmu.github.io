		Click on canvas to toggle iteration.
		<p/>
		Every pixel holds a point on the unit circle (mapped onto the
		circle inscribed in the square red[0,1] x green[0,1]) and on every
		step of the simulation, you average the point with its neighbors.
		<p/>
		If every pixel held an arbitrary point in the plane, this would just be a blur.
		But if we average a set of points on the unit circle, and then <b>normalize</b>
		to get back onto the unit circle, we end up with "clockwise" and
		"counterclockwise" singularities, which attract one another and annihilate.
