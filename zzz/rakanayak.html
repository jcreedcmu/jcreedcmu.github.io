<div class="para row">Yedreni’s legacy is complicated: he rose to power through means that
were considered legitimate (both at the time and presently &mdash; there
was no coup, there was no rule broken) yet the way he used the the
power that he obtained is not looked on favorably anymore. He made the
wars in the east seemed justified: there were valuable agricultural
resources that were being inefficiently managed by the local
populations, and asserting ownership would lead to less hunger and
starvation among both the arken and kolangan populations, an
objectively good outcome. The catastrophic diplomatic consequences
were not anticipated.</div>
<div class="para row">Funding for maintenance on the memorial has been hard to find; a
minimal amount is quietly funnelled from general budgets for museums
and parks just to avoid structural collapse of the structure, which is
made out of materials that do not hold up well with the increased
rainflow due to the unanticipated ket-cell reorganization of the last
thirty years or so. Nobody in power wants to be seen as supporting it,
even though some genuinely do remember some aspects of Yedreni’s
tenure with nostalgia.</div>

<div class="para row">Constructed with the support of a bequest by the descendants of Ot
Furovyaitch, the observatory has its lower levels open to the public
(at no cost) as a sort of museum and educational center, and its
uppermost level still functions as a primitive ket observatory, even
though more modern analysis tools have largely rendered it obsolete.</div>
<div class="para row">Visitors can see the treated glass through which ket-signs are
rendered visible, and hear the history of their manufacture. The
concerns of the previous century were more about ensuring <i>enough</i>
rainfall, and minimizing cognitive side-effects, which at the time was
a matter of encouraging people to stay indoors and away from weapons
and fires.</div>

<div class="para row">It is hard to reconcile, for an outside observer, how often No. 7 is
discussed in local conversations, by politicians and common folk
alike, with the fact that it continues misfunctioning year after year,
with no increase in funding. Its employees, regularly interviewed on
television, appear fatalistic, crack jokes at their own expense &mdash;
even the management. All of them attempt to firefight individual
problems as they arise, but problems arise constantly, leading to
frequent contamination of the water supply in the west side of the
city. Inhabitants there know not to drink the tap water without
boiling it, but even then there are industrial byproducts unaffected
by boiling that cause an increase in birth defects and psychological
effects not unlike ket-sickness.</div>

<div class="para row">In the current ket-cell organization, during about half the year, in
the fall and winter months, Rakanayak is shrouded in fog for several
hours in the mornings and evenings. Automobile and bicycle accidents
are more common, as they coincide with the times that impatient
commuters are trying to get to and from their jobs. Apart from this
it’s not thought of something as being in-character for the city:
Rakanayak wants to think of itself as a beacon, as radiant, as
clear-sighted. The fog leads to malaise, indecisiveness and broad
discontent. The suicide rate peaks near the late middle of winter. The
temperatures don’t descend below freezing very often, but often enough
to exacerbate problems driving.</div>

<div class="para row">An expansive, successful, and storied tavern serving a wide range of
alcoholic drinks, and some small dishes of food. Chiefly orgimnet
(fried salted dough, dipped in sauces) and rwuten sausage. The drinks
cover the range of flavors: sweet, sour, woody, astringent vegetable,
oily, nostalgic, and spicy.</div>

<div class="para row">Sauce Monarch has essentially a monopoly on condiments and frozen
foods anywhere east of the rakayanaks. Their logo is a stylized
picture of 5 Tashuen with a benevolent but mischievous expression. The
company is almost two hundred years old. The company was founded in
y2997 by a pair of brothers that had a terrace farm in south-west
Urrakeny left by their parents, who had abandoned them for an
apocalyptic cult in Rujokatch. They spent a few years growing staple
grains and managing nebu for dairy products, but grew obsessed with
breeding different strains of garlic, and then later hot peppers.</div>

<div class="para row">A bureaucratic fight a couple generations ago led to the division of
Res 6 into 6a and 6b. A certain civil servant named Yadra, whom
several decorative fountains are now named after, spent an enormous
amount of time studying the language of the binding project
commitments the city government had made. He had been assigned by
lottery to Res 6, and was generally disliked by its manager, named
Utliobas. As a sort of petty revenge, Yadra found a rule that allowed
any member of the service to execute the effects of a vote of no
confidence against the manager, so long as certain
health-and-well-being metrics fell below a certain level. Yadra’s
accomplice Turs accomplished a mix of making the metrics worse in
reality, and fudging them a bit further in the bookkeeping. Yadra
expected to be put in charge of the entire neighborhood, but Utliobas
found another loophole whereby his own personal track record with the
service entitled him to assert higher priority over a certain fraction
of area of the district: and so that was Res 6a.</div>
<div class="para row">Yadra’s skill in manipulating rules to his own ends did not extend to
skill at actually managing a neighborhood, and so Res 6b fell into
some disrepair.</div>

<div class="para row">The superstition held by the older residents of this neighborhood is
that someone is trying to watch them go about their daily activities.
For this reason, they put opaque curtains and boards up behind what
few windows they have (for, architecturally, there are as few as the
building codes permit) and paint them with images of eyes, facing
outwards. Residents say that if they (and by extension their homes)
are vigilant in surveying the outside, then the outside cannot view
them. The motif of the eye proliferates in all graphical work in the
area. Even the younger occupants, who believe less in the superstition
per se, embrace its iconography.</div>
<div class="para row">In practice, the result of the neighborhood is one of extremely low
visibility. Tax collection is impossible. There are entire buildings
missing from the deed registration records. Businesses fail whose
owners inquire too vigorously about the precise source of their bulk
orders. But somehow the neighborhood as a whole thrives, outside the
gaze of the municipal government. It’s not clear whether this is a
miracle that can be replicated, because it’s not accurate to say that
it is not governed at all.</div>

<div class="para row">Number 4 has greenery, but in the wrong places. It was architected in
the first place as a nonresidential area, covered in concrete, and
full of warehouses. Illegal squats moved in whenever the warehouses
were insufficiently policed. The squatters formed their own gangs and
ad-hoc governance for a decade or so. This ended when a canny,
violent, and charismatic youth figured he could probably outmaneuver
his rivals by approaching the city government and applying for
neighborhood status, reclaiming the otherwise unallocated number 4.
The city was motivated to accept &mdash; legitimizing the neighborhood
allowed an excuse to increase police funding, and Yekar had enough
support from his own gang that the police only had to fight two gangs
instead of three.</div>
<div class="para row">Unfortunately, Yekar was assassinated three years later, and the
neighborhood has reverted to a state of neglect and comparative
anarchy. Although, naturally, the arken notion of “anarchy” is a
degree of orderliness other cities would envy.</div>

<div class="para row">A members-only drinking club operated by a group called, derisively,
the Yumostev (’wind-followers’) an offshoot of the Babokaba. They were
pengerrand criminals who, when war came to them from the west, decided
it was more practical to take bribes and sell information. They
eventually found themselves extremely unwelcome in their own home, and
migrated to the territory of their business partners. The intrinsic
chauvinism of rakanayak meant that they had difficulty making lasting
friendships there, as well, and so they tried to stick together. “The
North Bank” referred to that of the Penger river, which few of the
Yumostev actually lived in, but it served well as an aspirational
label.</div>
<div class="para row">The quality of their liquor collection was middling by pengerrand
standards &mdash; and appalling to a native of rakanayak.
