<h2>1. The Lows (aka, the Yunga, the wilderness)</h2>

  </div></div>
<div class="para row">The low-shacks, built by ex-soldiers and immigrants, often lack power
and running water. The name is more to do with their status than their
height: some are as many as three or four stories. Structural
collapses, even fatal ones, are not uncommon.</div>
<div class="para row">Despite the relative poverty of its inhabitants, the Lows are an
essential part of Pengerrand. They are where everybody, rich and poor
alike, go to get their car repaired, listen to live music, watch
sports matches, eat the most interesting food. Crime, an an informal
sense, is low; the people are concerned with maintaining the spirit
(they might say the “art") of <i>pangatoi</i>, de-escalation, conflict
resolution, compromise: literally, “listening". There is little
violence and comparatively little theft. Violations of law are
somewhat common, but they are most often of the form of licensing
violations and tax evasion. The bureaucracy of the city is not much
respected.</div>
</div>
<br><a id="anchor1"></a><div class="section-body">
<h2>2. The Graffiti</h2>
<div class="para row"><div class="functional">

  </div></div>
<div class="para row">One of the few forms of “crime” that is persistent is graffiti, across
all neighborhoods. The “Critique” (the common name for the Pengerrand
Metropolitan Committee for Assessment of Quality of Spontaneous
Community-Led Aesthetic Modification) has at least caused the more
unappealing forms of vandalism to decrease.</div>
</div>
<br><a id="anchor2"></a><div class="section-body">
<h2>3. The Mayor's Office</h2>
<div class="para row"><span class="bold-label">Conflict with: </span> The Lows.</div>
<div class="para row"><div class="functional">
  <span class="label">dysfunctional</span>
  <span class="empty-square"></span><span class="fill-square"></span><span class="fill-square"></span><span class="fill-square"></span><span class="fill-square"></span>
  </div></div>
<div class="para row">The Mayor almost always has an adversarial relationship with the
Yunga. For historical reasons, the tournament of elections that result
in the selection of the Mayor leave the Yunga with effectively about a
third as many votes as citizens north of the river.</div>
<div class="para row">Since it represents only a minority of the city, the Mayor often
enacts policies that turn out to be either unpopular (because they are
in conflict with certain interests) or ineffective (because they fail
to take into account hidden complexities with the minority are unaware
of).</div>
</div>
<br><a id="anchor3"></a><div class="section-body">
<h2>4. The Red Marsh</h2>
<div class="para row"><div class="functional">

  </div></div>
<div class="para row">An area around the Penger river, spanning both the north and south
banks. Designated as a park by the city. There are often floating
market-boats on the Yunga side, and walkways on the north.</div>
<div class="para row">It is a quiet and pleasant place to be on a mild summer evening,
watching a sunset. The blood petrels tend to eat all the nuisance
insects, and the only ones that remain are the various species of
fireflies that glow orange, and pink, and red, giving the marsh its
name.</div>
</div>
<br><a id="anchor4"></a><div class="section-body">
<h2>5. Central Art Supply</h2>
<div class="para row"><span class="bold-label">Supported by: </span> The Graffiti</div>

  </div></div>
<div class="para row">A store just south of the river, in a commercial neighborhood. It’s
rather old compared to its immediate neighbors, having been passed
down in a family for a few generations now. Vandals from around the
city and suburbs buy their paint and printing materials here.</div>
<div class="para row">Constantly in conflict with the city’s zoning administration, who have
been somewhat more successful in trying to put it out of business for
failure to pay taxes. The shambling mess of architecture that the
store sprawls across is starting to show its age. Roofs and interior
pipes leak, damaging supplies.</div>
</div>
<br><a id="anchor5"></a><div class="section-body">
<h2>6. The Ministry of Architecture</h2>
<div class="para row"><span class="bold-label">Conflict with: </span> The Lows</div>

  <span class="fill-square"></span><span class="fill-square"></span><span class="fill-square"></span><span class="fill-square"></span><span class="fill-square"></span>
  </div></div>
<div class="para row">New construction is meant to be approved by the ministry, but illegal
construction is far more common than legal in the sprawl of the yunga.</div>
<div class="para row">The ministry is a husk of what it was a century hence: Pengerrand
began its current iteration a century and a half ago as an experiment
in trying to enforce consistency in design, in imitation of the
renovations in Urrakeny, but the practices did not take root.</div>
</div>
<br><a id="anchor6"></a><div class="section-body">
<h2>7. Utsbak Slopes</h2>
<div class="para row"><div class="functional">
  <span class="label">functional</span>
  <span class="empty-square"></span><span class="empty-square"></span><span class="empty-square"></span><span class="empty-square"></span><span class="fill-square"></span>
  </div></div>
<div class="para row">Some neighborhoods on the south bank of the Penger, not far from the
Marsh, that are a bit more middle-class than the Lows.</div>
<div class="para row">The area considered the “slopes” is expanding somewhat in recent years
to the neighboring flats. There’s a thriving cluster of Gorgobyan
restaurants at the western fringe of it.</div>
</div>
<br><a id="anchor7"></a><div class="section-body">
<h2>8. Erosion near the Penger River</h2>
<div class="para row"><div class="functional">
  <span class="label">highly dysfunctional</span>
  <span class="fill-square"></span><span class="fill-square"></span><span class="fill-square"></span><span class="fill-square"></span><span class="fill-square"></span>
  </div></div>
<div class="para row">The river grows a little in width every year as more soil is washed
away. The residents of the Lows migrate more easily, but the once
high-value houses on the north bank are threatened. Some neighborhoods
have been gutted and essentially turned into a northern version of the
lows. The houses themselves (those that haven’t been fortified) are
unsafe, in the process of collapse, though it doesn’t deter the
squatters.</div>
</div>
<br><a id="anchor8"></a><div class="section-body">
<h2>9. Builders & Planners</h2>
<div class="para row"><span class="bold-label">Conflict with: </span> The Ministry of Architecture</div>
<div class="para row"><div class="functional">
  <span class="label">dysfunctional</span>
  <span class="empty-square"></span><span class="fill-square"></span><span class="fill-square"></span><span class="fill-square"></span><span class="fill-square"></span>
  </div></div>
<div class="para row">The trade union has different priorities from the ministry; they want
their folks to get paid, and to not get maimed by falling beams. They
could care less about aesthetic cohesion. In fact they prefer a bit of
variety, and if fashion mandates you knock down your house and build
one that’s more current, so much the better.</div>
<div class="para row">Nobody really pays dues anymore, so the headquarters is looking a bit
shabby. The bylaws are ignored, and the chairpersonship is determined
mostly by seniority, and has little actual power. The organization as
a whole still has some cohesion: its members look out for one another.</div>
</div>
<br><a id="anchor9"></a><div class="section-body">
<h2>10. Immigration</h2>
<div class="para row"><span class="bold-label">Supported by: </span> The Lows</div>

  </div></div>
<div class="para row">Nice weather, plentiful cheap (albeit flimsy and dilapidated) housing,
a ready market for extranational trinkets and cuisines, and a
generally cosmopolitan welcomingness toward strangers make Pengerrand
a beacon for immigrants.</div>
<div class="para row">Immigration is easy and well-supported by the state. Permanent
residency is granted for almost all foreign citizens without a
criminal record &mdash; and even some of those if the crimes are
determined to be political ("targoroi") rather than civil ("manoi") or
moral ("sukemjot") in nature &mdash; on a yearly renewing basis, and full
citizenship after as little as three years. Two of the last three
mayors were not born in Pengerrand (but were born to somewhat wealthy
families elsewhere)</div>
