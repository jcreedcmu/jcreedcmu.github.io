<div class="para row">The three languid rivers (from west to east) Gaio, Yanda, and Rak come
together in Serkaioba Bay.</div>
<div class="para row">The natural harbor formed by Serkaioba Bay is essentially <i>the</i> reason
Serkaioba exists. It provides protection from attackers, stabilizes
the ket, and makes shipping convenient.</div>

<div class="para row">The commonest form of houses in Serkaioba (and indeed across Arkeny)
have many replaceable parts: entire wall sections are standardized,
and though they are made of cheap materials, and break easily, and are
easily stained or lose their color over time, they are cheap to
replace. Bathrooms fixtures are single pieces that can be efficiently
cleaned or replaced without very specialized tools. Because of this,
the chief differentiator of houses is color and pattern. Some colors
are scarce (either artificially due to corporate and legal
constraints, or naturally, because some vibrant dyes are more
expensive to manufacture) and therefore indicators of status.</div>

</div></div>
<div class="para row">The pay-by-weight food hall is the source of the typical working lunch
in Serkaioba; all classes eat here side-by-side, office managers and
construction laborers alike. The reasonable-person-principle of the
thing is that people promise implicitly not to game the different
costs of different foods, but in point of fact the foods available
(mostly stews of various sorts, which use meat only for flavoring and
not for the main bulk, with rice and potatoes and rangal for sides)
tend to have the same calorie density and roughly the same cost per
pound anyhow. There are some status games played by the beers and
liquors people bring with them &mdash; of exotic, hard-to-procure hot
sauces &mdash; but generally it is an efficient and equitable system for
feeding the downtown throngs.</div>
<div class="para row">The breakfast offerings, while somewhat less attended, are also
delicious: pepper eggs, soft sweet rice cakes, seasonal fruit, and
fish.</div>

<div class="para row">A sprawling and sumptuous public park. Once the communal holding of
the Keru, the brick wall surrounding it was smashed apart in various
sections during the anti-oligarch riots of 2988. Only one small piece
of it remains, now under glass. Shallow ponds have been built in the
shape of calligraphically rendered symbols. There are fruit and berry
trees, and a variety of spice-bushes. Park-goers play sports, stroll,
and lounge on artificial sand dunes by the central lake.</div>

</div></div>
<div class="para row">Serkaioba is quite hilly closer to the rivers, and staircases snake up
and down the cliffs. Some houses have no direct access to roads, and
from them a modest climb (or descent) is required to reach one.</div>
<div class="para row">Their steps are often made from the same modular and colorful
materials as are used in buildings. Sometimes instead wood, or
compressed discarded inkfruit husks. The railings of those that have
been built or rebuilt recently are more simple and functional, but
ornate metal decorations can be found closer to the old center of the
city.</div>

<div class="para row">Windows are more often circular than rectangular in serkaoiba. They
are more expensive to manufacture, but are considered aesthetically
superior. Circles abound in the visual grammar of the city.
Roundabouts govern traffic. Osculating curves arising from
arrangements of circles occur in logos and flags. Doorways are topped
with circular arches. Cakes, breads, and other foods are cut into
circular shapes. Coliseums and theaters are round.</div>

<div class="para row">The GB6 famously collapsed in 3189, during rush hour, killing dozens
of commuters. There has been conspiracy-minded speculation as to
whether it failure was caused by sabotage. Official accounts blame an
unanticipated chemical reaction. A thick covering of yellow
Ketepmorynot mold had grown over its piers shortly after its
construction. The piers were unusually made of vlorinite imported from
the north, which seemed to catalyze the mold’s growth. Over time the
waste products of the mold invisibly weakened the piers, and even the
ones farther from the center of the river (where the failure first
occurred) were revealed by later testing to be very close to failure.</div>

<div class="para row">Although car ownership is not uncommon, the intracity train system is
robust enough to satisfy the needs of many commuters. The majority of
it is elevated, and trains cross the rivers on most of the same
bridges that cars, bicycles, and pedestrians do. Serkaiobans tend to
be pragmatic rather than ideological about transportation choices:
different distances make different modes appropriate. Some residents
have greater or lesser need for route consistency.</div>
<div class="para row">Few complain about the taxes required to support universal fareless
entry, and the few that do are mostly pengerra anyway, whose opinions
can be disregarded. Let them look at the spreadsheets themselves and
see that this is the most cost-effective compromise. The train routes
to other cites is urrakeny could use some improvement, true, and above
all it would be nicer if there were greater integration between them
and the S-trains &mdash; the tracks are compatible but politics is an
obstacle &mdash; but nothing in life is ever finished sooner than a
hundred lifetimes.</div>

<div class="para row">Of all the twelve screaming-houses in serkaioba, the red is the most
tragic. It is named not for the color of its tilework &mdash; which is
mostly white and blue, with occasional decorations of green and
charcoal &mdash; but for the murders of 3147 that haunt its domes and
passages. Yailo has forsaken this place. The common understanding is
that the insult that drove away the protecing spirit occurred much
earlier, in the middle of the 3120s, when the enemies of the temple
were allowed to do business within its walls. They sold disgusting
foods, blasphemous tonics.</div>
<div class="para row">The sessions in the Wuchka lost their harmony after that time. Those
in attendance did not find themselves cleansed of their unruly
feelings &mdash; instead the feelings were amplified. The shouts and
screams were no longer music. They became anger and discord. Dances
became fights. Yailo died there &mdash; transformed into Radrem, the
headless winged talon, who tore flesh.</div>

</div></div>
<div class="para row">The name of the most central train station in serkaioba is, in a way,
a pun: on the one hand, it is clearly the principal station, with at
least twice as many connected lines, daily passengers, and pec flowing
through its retail concessions as the next busiest station in the
region. On the other hand, its current name is a compromise: it used
to be that it was renamed after every new principal was elected. In
early 3167, it was still known as Yelechku Station, after the outgoing
Principal Adrim Yelechku. After the Table Affair ended his already
rocky political career for good, the incoming Principal Riaic
fulfilled her campaign promise of “selfless governance” in, among
other ways, breaking tradition and renaming it generically. Principals
following her have since made the same decision.</div>
