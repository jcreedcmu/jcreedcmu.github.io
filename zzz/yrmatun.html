<div class="para row">The Yrmatun Exposition Center and Gathering Hall was bombed a hundred
and thirty nine years ago, and its wooden internal structure caught
fire, and its outer stonework was damaged by the fire, and by vandals
and thieves. The rubble remains here at the very heart of the city,
haunted, preserved in its useless state, kept sacred after a fashion.</div>
<div class="para row">Though it’s a profane sort of sacredness: tourists still take pebbles
home with them, and none of the locals stop them, although they do
complain. A few benches have sleeping occupants during the day, though
not at night &mdash; there’s no peace. Fights and impromptu concerts would
make sleep impossible.</div>

  </div></div>
<div class="para row">There is a long tradition of carving &mdash; by using proper, whitemetal
knives &mdash; pieces of wood into knife-shapes. They are not particularly
useful for cutting other pieces of wood, even when heat-hardened. It
was believed to be a matter of good luck to have a wood knife to scare
away hygrakym. Large quantities of them were once sold to tourists,
but many years ago an unwell man took one of them from a sales-bench
and stabbed three in the crowd, killing one. Since then, their
manufacture, sale, and possession has been officially banned. A black
market exists. Many hide one in their home. All manner of contemporary
ills and misfortunes are blamed on the absence of wood knives, and on
the now fearless hygrakym.</div>

<h2>3. The Four Actors</h2>

  </div></div>
<div class="para row">Four statues surround a central pond, whose water is replenished by
the rain. Lichens grow at the bottom of the basin, and the statues
have a thin layer of pigeon dung. They are images of the four actors,
important figures in the cosomology of Ishtaq. No self-respecting
citizen of Yrmatun believes in Ishtaq anymore, but all the same they
know every detail of its theology.</div>
<div class="para row">Each figure is depicted as androgynous, and not particularly beautiful
or ugly. The first in the traditional order, located at the southern
end of the artificial pond, is Jumi, the rule-maker, whose hands are
large. The second (at the eastern point) is Qomi, the rule-follower,
whose eyes are set somewhat far apart, and whose hair is long. The
third, seated, at the north, is Yrmi, the one who experiences, whose
head is small, squeezed in by the pressure of the outside world
impinging eternally on it. The last, standing to the west, is Anmi,
the one who decides (or sometimes variously translated as “requests",
“petitions", “directs", “demands", “wills") whose mouth is open, and
enlarged, as if shouting.</div>
<div class="para row">Together they are understood as four facets of the individual
consciousness, and of the cosmos.</div>

<h2>4. Munishtaq Naturalization Bureau</h2>
<div class="para row"><div class="functional">
  <span class="label">dysfunctional</span>
  <span class="empty-square"></span><span class="fill-square"></span><span class="fill-square"></span><span class="fill-square"></span><span class="fill-square"></span>
  </div></div>
<div class="para row">Every step is difficult. First one must contact the office to obtain
the paperwork for an entry permit. The bureau has no public telephone
number or mailing address: the standard protocol is to have a friend
of a friend smuggle the form out. The form itself is long, and
intrusively asks for many personal details. Previous residences,
friends, lovers, associations joined, food preferences, artistic
taste, musical taste. Of course, expressing any sufficiently strong
preference for nonfunctional visual or auditory art can be
disqualifying. And this is the form for tourists!</div>
<div class="para row">A person who has visited munishtaq three times and who has not
committed any crime may discover that they are required to make a
pilgrimage to the suboffice of permanent residency located in a
northerly neighborhood of Yrmatun named Rypomadr, nestled in wooded
hills. It has electricity, but no telephone lines at all. It is
administered by the same handful of misanthropic hermits for the last
thirty-two years. They pore over the records of current permanent
residents, and think of unpleasant errands to send them on, and tasks
for them to do &mdash; if any task is not completed, they are deported.</div>
<div class="para row">Nine years of permanent residency without any crimes makes one
eligible, in principle, to apply for citizenship. But citizenship is
only granted at the whim of the naturalization council, which meets
sporadically and unpredictably. Statutory requirements would have them
meet at least once a year, but in practice it’s once every couple
years or so, depending on the volume of petitioning. An applicant has
a better chance of approval if they have started a successful
business, written a book, or has made a similarly visible contribution
to Munishtaq society.</div>
<div class="para row">The absurd difficulty paradoxically makes citizenship highly prized,
and sought after by many foreigners, despite the fact that the intent
of the system is to dissuade them. Would-be Yrmatuni share advice and
help one another.</div>

<h2>5. Temple to Uzmodr</h2>

  </div></div>
<div class="para row">Those born in Yrmatun, who have been shaped by its culture, sneer at
the massive temple on its eastern fringe, for it represents everything
they hate: religiosity, obsession with purity and cleanliness, and the
naive optimism that problems can be solved, that the human condition
can be improved.</div>
<div class="para row">It is scrupulously maintained by outsiders, foreigners, immigrants.
The hand of Uzmodr reaches far across the continent. Its exterior
walls are cream-colored. Its interior is colorful, decorated with
frescoes and architectural bagatelles.</div>
<div class="para row">The temple’s army of volunteers prepare and serve food to the poor &mdash;
and, inevitably also the financially comfortable but opportunistic,
who cynically admire themselves for taking resources from those that
would lead Yrmatun down the wrong path.</div>

<h2>6. The Two Families</h2>

<div class="para row">The poem goes:</div>
<div class="para row"><blockquote style="white-space: pre; font-style: italic;">In Yrmatun there are two trees
Tolreb and Vidjemot they are called
Their roots are intertwined
Red and yellow are their leaves</blockquote></div>
<div class="para row">Every citizen knows whether they are Tolreb, or Vidjemot, or neither.
Almost all foreign-born are officially neither, even if they can
plausibly trace some ancestry. Cases where naturalized citizens are
adopted into one family or the other are exceedingly rare, and occur
under very special circumstances. In the last hundred years, the
Tolreb council has admitted three military heroes as honorary members,
and Vidjemot just one person, an print artist, for the reason of her
continuing financial and cultural contributions to the family over
decades.</div>
<div class="para row">The two families see the other as rivals, but it is, in recent times,
more or less a healthy and productive rivalry.</div>

<div class="para row">Once a prison, it is now a popular tourist attraction. It is said to
be where Ep Nebarga was held, twin brother of Ep Yehura. The critical
detail in the story was that Nebarga had a burn scar on his hand, from
boiling water when he was young. Nebarga committed a political crime
against the aristocracy of Yrmatun during its height as a city-state,
and was arrested. Through sign language he communicated to Yehura
where he was being held, even though the authorities tried to keep it
secret.</div>
<div class="para row">Yehura burned his hand on purpose, and used it to convince a
superstitious mob that he was Nebarga’s spirit, projected from inside
Hroma. The mob demanded the release of the corporeal Nebarga, for fear
that he would do more evil magic to Yrmatun as revenge. Nebarga and
Yehura then fled south to Jdayalur, and had further frauds and
misadventures.</div>

  </div></div>
<div class="para row">For a few months every year the winter market shambles into existence.
The number of arrests the last time it convened broke all records.
There were the usual raft of license violations, immigration offenses,
unregistered tourists, unsafe food practices, and so on. Nothing too
surprising there. The extra boost came from a combination of unusually
high organized crime activity (based in the barbaric south, naturally)
and one notable conflict over a perceived violation of intellectual
property rights: philosophy books were being sold that were
(allegedly) plagiarized from the work of an author, Ye Matr, who
himself had been a regular vendor at the winter market for many years.
Consequently, there were a large crowd of his &mdash; let us
diplomatically say: enthusiastic &mdash; supporters queueing for
autographs and sharing drinks. When one of their friends returned from
the sausage stand with word that The Causes of Value was being sold,
the queue immediately disbanded and became a mob, which marched south
with holy purpose south towards Anporul and his publisher’s kiosk.
Anporul survived, but only after a week-long stay in hospital, during
which he acquired a secondary infection, and nearly lost a lung.</div>
<div class="para row">Unfortunately for Ye Matr’s readers, this led to an increase in sales
of Anporul’s book, and once recovered, he found himself a very wealthy
man.</div>

<h2>9. Meat Pies</h2>

  </div></div>
<div class="para row">Yrmatuni love their meat pies. They’re sold at literally every
business that sells food &mdash; as required by a city-wide law, which the
butcher’s union lobbied for. But it almost isn’t necessary. It’s
expected in any case. Of the three or four daily meals, (depending,
respectively, on whether you are Tolreb or Vidjemot) there’s a variant
of the basic meat pie that is specialized for that time of day. Fish
is considered best for breakfast. Droub is used for the large midday
meal. If you’re Vidjemot and prefer a small tav and a snack in the
afternoon, you typically want a pie filled with onions and a mixed
puree of organ-meats from different animals. For dinner, the role of
meat is minimized, but still present: perhaps just some bacon or
tallow in a fruit pie, while the majority of the meal is rice or
boiled roots.</div>

<h2>10. Theater of Okinye</h2>

  </div></div>
<div class="para row">This is the meeting-house where the Friends of Okinye met, whose
purpose was confused and unclear after the rebellion, after a fashion,
achieved its aims. The government of Zramsd was toppled, and its
leaders were murdered, and those that were responsible lived here &mdash;
all of these fact lie in the hindmost parts of the consciousness of
the Yrmatuni. Today Yrmatun is auomatically allied with the city of
Zramsd, inasmuch that they are both part of the same polity. But the
rootless, restless zroji dwelling in Yrmatun &mdash; who still think of
the minister Wid as their hero &mdash; therefore also still think of the
unpunished Ygaramayot, in whose ear the Tar whsipered, as their
historical enemy.</div>
<div class="para row">The house is in a state of near-ruin. Its beams are damaged, and,
uncharacteristically for Yrmatun, its exterior is covered in bitter
and angry messages.</div>

<h2>11. The great fire of 2992</h2>

<div class="para row">If you pay close attention to historical records, it becomes clear
that Yrmatun had an entirely different personality before the fire:
more optimistic and more spiritual. Essentially all wooden buildings
were destroyed, except for the “blessed” fish market. With them so too
died the city’s connection to the ket, to Uzmodr, and to Ishtaq,
according to the temple elders.</div>
<div class="para row">The event is scarcely spoken of by natives, and not emphasized in
childhood education &mdash; except inasmuch as the history of the city
before that point is not discussed much either, so that the fire
serves as a silent marker of the modern city’s birth.</div>
