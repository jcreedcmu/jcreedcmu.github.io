<div class="para row">A historical graveyard where several famous figures from history are
buried. Not many places are still available, except to the very rich
and well-connected. Cremation is much more popular these days besides.</div>
<div class="para row">It functions more like a park than a graveyard. The paths are
well-maintained, and the scenery is attractive, if morbid. It tends
not to bother the residents. No particularly separate
rules of decorum apply here, which horrifies some foreign visitors.</div>

<div class="para row">Imnereskne was a city of letters fifty years ago: writers flocked
here, and printing businesses thrived. Yarminna had a considerable
empire built on vertical integration, despite the absence of a
monopoly in any particular segment. Nonetheless they cut down their
own forests, printed their own paper, bound their own books, and hired
the most popular serial writers, and paid them by the pound. They did
well for a while, but war came from the west, and their forests, their
factories and their offices were expropriated or destroyed. The paper
factory was the one exception: but with the rest of their business
gutted, it fell into disuse.</div>

<div class="para row">A small neighborhood drugstore in East Byangon. They mainly sell
various sandwiches and soups and dumplings, pain remedies, digestive
snacks, desserts, ket patches, toilet paper, and fruit. They also do a
little under-the-table savings-and-loan business for the regulars,
with very reasonable interest rates. Business has picked up since the
dairy store across the street closed up due to the owner dying
childless.</div>

<h2>4. Street Drummers</h2>

  </div></div>
<div class="para row">Of all the buskers and street musicians, the drummers are the biggest
nuisance: they leave their gourds out to rot and attract wild pigs,
and needless to say they make the most cacophonous noise. Usually the
guitarrists at least have some talent, but the rise of drumming as a
central focus of Imnereskne music, as well as the affordability of
miscellaneous objects that might count as percussion instruments,
means that just about everyone, talented or not, makes an attempt.</div>

<div class="para row">A restaurant that serves fried dough, potato desserts, spiced steak,
honey wine, and other local specialties. It’s commonly known to be a
money-laundering front for the Babokaba, a criminal organization whose
influence is diffused over the peninsula, and which is somewhat in
decline lately. Sparsely populated as always, some of the menu items
have started to be unavailable due to the absence of enough funds
coming in.</div>

<div class="para row">The ring road that encircles Imnereskne, constructed a few decades ago
in an attempt to mitigate traffic jams on the more major radial roads,
has its wayfinding signage covered in graffiti and other projects of
vandalism.</div>
<div class="para row">Entire segments of it are unusable, having been scavenged for reusable
chunks of concrete. At best, one has to keep an eye out for stationary
carts and settlments. The traffic jams on the spoke roads and downtown
are about as worse as ever.</div>

<div class="para row">Children often tell stories of the paper factory being haunted. You
are not supposed to wear anything but gray clothing when exploring its
interior.</div>
<div class="para row">Morbid stories of mythological creatures &mdash; in states of death, or of
a nature that defies categorization into alive and dead &mdash; are
central to the storytelling traditions in Imnereskne. The principal
function of a story is, according to these traditions, to take someone
out of the mundane world, to enter into a space where humans are not
necessarily welcome. The protagonist typically enters a cave, or hole,
or goes down a well, or climbs a hill, or opens a door that seems to
lead nowhere &mdash; or is attacked without provocation &mdash; or commits a
terrible crime while ket-mad and undergoes a transformation as
punishment.</div>

<div class="para row">A retirement home adjoining a hospital. Its courtyard has a variety of
colorful plants, originally foreign, but bred to be adapted to the
relatively undramatic seasons on the bay coast. There is a pond
with blue and yellow fish. Its name is a reference to a novel &mdash;
there is a quote by Hamr on a plaque near the entrance, about the end
of life being the time appropriate to take all of one’s experiences,
and synthesize them into a coherent whole through writing. Hamr’s four
novels were all written in a span of three years after he turned
seventy-one. White Bark and Green Branches was the last of these,
after which he only wrote some poetry whose structure is still fairly
disputed by scholars that study him.</div>

<div class="para row">It’s not entirely clear why an underwhelming Juta monarch (of Negima
birth) deserved a statue here in the fist place &mdash; but it is revered
as a sort of magnet of artistic potential. Other statues appear, and
even are immune from the erstwhile impulse of the city to coat every
surface with permanent marks, as a sort of commentary. For some reason
the rule is suspended here. It is a civic shrine.</div>

<div class="para row">The round is located in the heart of the city, and here is where all
significant events take place. Concerts are common, especially of
percussionists. The arena is well-suited for competitive sports when
it is not raining. The temperature is sufficiently high year-round for
some sort of sports, but the choice varies seasonally. Famous protests
have converged here &mdash; politicians have spoken here before their
election, rallying the &mdash; perhaps about ten or fifteen thousand &mdash;
in attendance.</div>
<div class="para row">Unlike many other event venues on the continent, it is a matter of
principle that attendance fees are not charged per se. Money is made
from food, from merchandise, from insurance, from security services.
Tickets are sold, but to be shown later as “proof of attendance", even
if you never attended.</div>
