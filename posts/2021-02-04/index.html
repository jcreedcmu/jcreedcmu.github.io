	 <h1>Surface Diagrams</h1>

	 Noam Zeilberger pointed out to me recently
	 that <a href="https://ncatlab.org/toddtrimble/published/Surface+diagrams">Todd
	 Trimble had written up</a> some material about how one might
	 approach formalizing $n$-dimensional surface diagrams
	 topologically. This post seems to be from about 10 years ago, and
	 indeed the history of this overall project seems to stretch quite
	 a few decades back in the research community. After skimming, I
	 felt encouraged by the fact that I had gotten as far as I had just
	 messing around with elementary definitions, but found the
	 complexity of the sort of weird counterexamples you need to
	 exclude &mdash; and of the machinery others have used to exclude them
	 &mdash; pretty sobering.
	 <p>

	 Still I have this sense (though perhaps this is merely wishful
	 thinking) that higher categories ought to have a very nice
	 parsimonious characterization &mdash; in particular I feel like
	 there ought to be some way of characterizing them without any
	 reference to the <i>analytic</i> structure of $\R^n$, just its
	 topological and order structure; i.e. without any mention of
	 tangent spaces and smooth manifolds and such.

	 <p>
		So here's my best guess at the moment, justified only by the
		fact that I think it rules out a couple of "monsters" I can
		think of.

	 <h2>The Data of a Surface Diagram</h2>

	 Here's a picture of what a typical string diagram &mdash; i.e. a
	 2-dimensional surface diagram &mdash; looks like.

	 <center><img src="string-diagram.png"></center>

	 We'll say that the underlying data of a diagram is a <i>picture</I> that assigns
	 to every point in $\R^2$ an answer to the question: which cell is located at that point?
	 That is, this particular diagram is a function
	 \[P : \R^2 \to \{C, D, E, F, f, g, h, k, \ell, \alpha, \beta\}\]
	 This data is going to be subject to some conditions that ensure that it actually looks like
	 a well-formed diagram, and not some random jumble of cells.
	 <p>
		Those conditions are going to feel inutitively like saying: near
		each point $x\in \R^2$, the picture $P$ resembles a "standard
		picture" that corresponds to the value $P(x)$ that $P$ takes at
		$x$. There will be a collection of standard pictures, one for each cell, which
		express both the <i>dimension</I> of that cell, and also the domain and codomain of higher cells.
		Here's what the standard pictures of the cells in this diagram could look like:
	 <center><img src="boundaries.png"></center>

	 We see that the standard pictures of the $0$-cells $C, D, E, F$
	 are maps $\R^0 \to \{C, D, E, F\}$. They're pretty trivial and boring;
	 they just assign to the unique point of $\R^0$ the value of the
	 cell whose picture it is.
	 <p>
		The standard pictures of the $1$-cells are maps $\R^1 \to \{C, D,
		E, F, f, g, h, k, \ell\}$. They map the origin to the 1-cell itself,
		all the negative numbers to the domain 0-cell of the 1-cell, and all the positive
		numbers to the codomain 0-cell.
	 <p>
		And the standard pictures of the $2$-cells $\alpha, \beta$ are maps
		\[  \R^2 \to \{C, D, E, F, f, g, h, k, \ell, \alpha, \beta\}\]
		that give a little picture of just that 2-cell by itself.
<p>
	 What all of these maps have in common is that the standard picture
	 for a cell has the cell itself at its origin: if the standard
	 picture for a cell $c$ is called $\partial_c$, then it has the
	 property that $\partial_c(0) = c$.

	 <h2>Orderly Maps</h2>
	 I want to make a couple of definitions to formalize what <b>resembles</b> means in
	 <blockquote>...near each point the picture <b>resembles</b> a standard picture...</blockquote>

	 Consider the category <b>OrdSp</b> of "orderly spaces" whose objects are topological spaces $X$
	 equipped with countably many binary relations ${&lt;_0}, {&lt;_1}, {&lt;_2}, \ldots$,
	 and whose morphisms are "orderly maps", continuous maps that preserve all those relations.
	 <p>Let's equip $\R^n$ with a specific collection of orders so that it lives canonically as an object
		in this category. If $x = (x_0, \ldots, x_{n-1})\in \R^n$ and $y = (y_0, \ldots, y_{n-1}) \in \R^n$
		we say that $x &lt;_m y$ iff either
		<ul>
		  <li>$m \ge n$; or
		  <li>$x_m &lt; y_m$ and for all $k > m$, we have $x_k = y_k$.
		</ul>
		where unsubscripted $&lt;$ means the usual notion of less-than in the reals.
		If we have a subset $U \subseteq \R^n$, then $U$ is also an orderly space in the evident way, by taking the
		subset topology, and taking the restriction to $U$ of the relations $&lt;_i$.

	 <p>
		An example of typical orderly map $\pi$ from an orderly space
		$U\subseteq \R^2$ to $\R$ can be illustrated as follows. We show
		a coloring of $\R$, thought of as a map $\partial : \R \to K$ to
		a set $K$ of colors, and we show the induced coloring $\partial \o \pi$ on $U$:
	 <center><img src="orderly.png"></center>
	 The coloring is allowed to wiggle back and forth freely in the $x_0$-axis (as time proceeds along the $x_1$ axis)
	 but within each constant $x_1$-slice we
	 have to have a monotone advancement from red, to orange, to yellow, etc. as we proceed
	 from left to right (because whenever $x &lt; y$, we'll  find that  $(x, t) &lt;_0 (y, t)$ in $U$,
	 which then requires $\pi(x_0) &lt; \pi(y_0)$)

	 <h2>Defining Good Pictures</h2>

	 Suppose we have a set $C$ of cells, and for each cell $c \in C$,
	 we're given a number $d(c)\in \N$ (the "dimension of $c$") and a map
	 $\partial_c : \R^{d(c)} \to C$ (the "boundary of $c$") such that $\partial_c(0) = c$.

	 A <i>picture</I> is a function $P : \R^n \to C$. A picture is <i>good</i> at a point $x \in \R^n$
	 iff there exists an open neighborhood $U\subseteq \R^n$ of $x$, and an orderly map $\pi : U \to \R^{d(P(x))}$
	 such that
	 <ul>
		<li> $\pi(x) = 0$
		<li> $\forall y \in U . P(y) = \partial_{P(x)}(\pi(y))$
	 </ul>
	 In other words: a picture is good at a point if a neighborhood of
	 that point agrees with the standard picture of the cell assigned
	 to that point, up to reparameterization by an orderly morphism.

	 <h2>Defining (something like) $\omega$-Categories</h2>
	 I think something like an $\omega$-category is given by the following definition, though I'd need
	 to define maps (and higher maps) between them to make that more formal:
	 <p>
		A <i>directed space</i> consists of a set $C$, a map $d : C \to \N$, and for each $c\in C$ a map
		$\partial_c : \R^{d(c)} \to C$ such that for every $c$ and every nonzero $x \in \R^{d(c)}$,
		<ul>
		  <li> $\partial_c(0) = c$
		  <li> $d(\partial_c(x)) < d(c)$
		  <li> $\partial_c$ is a good picture at $x$
		</ul>
