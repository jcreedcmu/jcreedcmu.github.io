    <h1>How to Invent Presheaves</h1>
    <p><b class="A">A</b>:
      So what was that question you had about orderings?
    <p><b class="B">B</b>:
      I know that if you have a total order $(X, \le)$, there's a sensible notion of
      what it means for a subset of $X$ to be a <em>prefix</em> of the whole order...
    <p><b class="A">A</b>:
      Sure. Everything in the subset should be less than everything not in it.
    <p><b class="B">B</b>:
      Something like that. But what would be the analogous property for partial orders?
    <p><b class="A">A</b>:
      I see, it isn't quite as obvious. There's not going to be one obvious cutoff. Because
      elements in a partial order might be incomparable...
    <p><b class="B">B</b>:
      Maybe we <i>should</I> require that there is a single 'cutoff' element? Here's a
    proposed definition:
    <blockquote>
      A subset $Y$ of a partial order $(X, \le)$ is a <em>prefix</em> if there exists a $y$ such that $Y = \{x \in X \st x \le y\}$.
    </blockquote>

    <p><b class="A">A</b>:
      That's an interesting definition, but it doesn't generalize our intuitions for total orders, I think.
    <p><b class="B">B</b>: Why not?

    <p><b class="A">A</b>: Think about the natural numbers $\N$. I
      figure that all of $\N$ ought to be considered a prefix of itself, and
      there's no greatest number, so your definition would exclude that.
    <p><b class="B">B</b>: Kk, but that feels like a weird edge
      case. Maybe we could say:
    <blockquote>
      A subset $Y$ of a partial order $(X, \le)$ is a <em>prefix</em> if
<ul>
<li> there exists a $y$ such that $Y = \{x \in X \st x \le y\}$, or
<li> $Y$ is all of $X$
</ul>
    </blockquote>


    <p><b class="A">A</b>: I can still come up with a total order where that doesn't coincide with what I think "prefix" ought to mean. How about two copies of the total order $\N$ consecutively one after the other:
      <center><img src="wplusw.png"></center>
      Do you agree that the set $\{0,1,2,\ldots\}$ is definitely a prefix of the whole order $\{0,1,2,\ldots,\omega,\omega+1,\omega+2,\ldots\}$?
    <p><b class="B">B</b>: I see. That is a prefix, and there's no single element $y$ for which $\{0,1,2,\ldots\}$ is
the set of things less-than-or-equal-to $y$. But wait --- it <em>is</em> the set of all things <i>strictly</i>
less than $\omega$! Let me try to salvage my definition one more time:
    <blockquote>
      A subset $Y$ of a partial order $(X, \le)$ is a <em>prefix</em> if
<ul>
<li> there exists a $y$ such that $Y = \{x \in X \st x \le y\}$, or
<li> there exists a $y$ such that $Y = \{x \in X \st x &lt; y\}$, or
<li> $Y$ is all of $X$
</ul>
    </blockquote>

    <p><b class="A">A</b>: In this case, I'd ask you whether you still expect $\{0,1,2,\ldots\}$ to
count as a prefix of the following total order, where I've concatenated $\N$ with another copy of $\N$ with
the order <em>reversed</em>:
      <center><img src="wpluswstar.png"></center>
(Bear in mind when I say $\omega - 1, \omega - 2, \ldots$, these are just names I've chosen for elements of this order;
I'm not claiming there's a countable ordinal $\omega - 2$ or anything like that.)
    <p><b class="B">B</b>: I admit I do expect that to be a prefix. And I see
      my proposed definition for posets doesn't include it. It's not the set of elements strictly below
      any single element, either.

    <p><b class="A">A</b>: Could we just somehow formally say "everything in the subset should be less than everything not in it"?
    <p><b class="B">B</b>: I think that's also too strong. If we had a bunch of parallel total orders, which completely are unrelated
to one another, and I have prefixes of each of the total orders
       I think the union of those prefixes should count as a prefix of the overall partial order. For example,
the set of orange numbers here should count as a prefix, I think.
      <center><img src="parallel.png"></center>

    <p><b class="A">A</b>: Yeah, I agree. And I see that if we said "everything in the prefix has to be $\le$ everything
in the complement of the prefix" that would rule this out. Because there's no "cross-talk" between the different copies
of $\N$. By assumption, they're unrelated.
    <p><b class="B">B</b>: How about this definition?
    <blockquote>
      A subset $Y$ of a partial order $(X, \le)$ is a <em>prefix</em> if
 for all $y \in Y$, and all $z \le y$, we have that also $z \in Y$.
    </blockquote>

    <p><b class="A">A</b>: So a set has to be <em>closed</em> downwardn the partial order.
      That feels right, and includes all of the examples above that we thought should count as prefixes.
