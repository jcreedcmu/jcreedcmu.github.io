      I wanted to start writing down some things working up to what I
		actually meant by it. So I'm going to start by telling a little backstory:
	 </p>
	 <h2>Linear Types in Logic Programming Proofs</h2>
	 <p>
		The line of thinking the tweet is referring to is something I've
		been ruminating about ever since
		my <a href="http://jcreed.org/papers/thesis-final-color.pdf">phd
		thesis</a>. The thesis work, in turn, came directly out of, some
		time in the early-mid 2000s,
		 <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~fp/">Frank</a> suggesting I think about the
		problem of, hey, wouldn't it be nice if we could
		take <a href="https://www.itu.dk/~carsten/">carsten's</a> LLF
		&mdash; a generalization of LF incorporating linear logic into
		the types &mdash; and actually prove theorems the same
		logic-programming sort of way you do in LF. The main problem is
		that even <I>stating</I> the theorems we wanted to prove seemed
		difficult!
	 </p>
	 <h3>Cut Admissibility</h3>
	 <p>
		A fairly representative hello-world sort of thing you prove in LF <I>without</I> any linearity
		is cut-elimination theorem for an intuitionistic propositional sequent calculus.
		You say things like
		<tt class="code">
		  o : type.
		</tt>
		to declare that <tt>o</tt> is a type of propositions, and
		<tt class="code">
		  hyp : o -> type.
		  conc : o -> type.
		</tt>
		to declare that you're able to hypothesize and conclude propositions, and then the type
		of the cut elimination function &mdash; to be written as a logic program &mdash; is
		<tt class="code">
		  cutAdmissible : conc A → (hyp A → conc C) → conc C → type.
		</tt>
		(with implicit universal quantification over both <tt>A</tt> and <tt>C</tt> since they're capitalized)
		together with some declarations saying that you intend to perform <tt>cutAdmissible</tt> with
		the first two arguments being input, and the last being output, and then twelf's totality checker
		goes to work on your logic program and (if it's written correctly) verifies that indeed logic programming
		execution will always terminate yielding something of type <tt>conc C</tt>.
	 </p>
	 <p>
		Thanks to the magic of higher-order abstract syntax, this can be
		shown to correspond exactly to proving the cut admissibility theorem as you'd usually state it:

		<center>If $\Gamma \prov A$ and $\Gamma, A \prov C$, then $\Gamma \prov C$.</center>

		The $\Gamma$s correspond to whatever assumptions <tt>hyp A</tt>
		are floating around ambiently when you run the logic program.
		It's a definite advantage of the twelf programming style that
		you don't really have to think about them except when you
		actually add variables to the context, or need to extract them
		from it. They just go along for the ride in a nice way, and what
		we wanted was exactly that same niceness to generalize to the
		linear case.
	 </p>
	 <h3>Linear Cut Admissibility</h3>
	 <p>
		So, I might paraphrase Frank as saying to me, let's think about
		how the <I>linear</I> cut admissibility theorem looks. It's

		<center>If $\Gamma \prov A$ and $\Delta, A \prov C$, then $\Gamma, \Delta \prov C$.</center>

		Where $\Gamma$ and $\Delta$ are now contexts of linear
		assumptions that don't satisfy contraction or weakening. If we
		try to write down a version of <tt>cutAdmissible</tt> for this
		theorem, we need to somehow accound for the fact that
		<ol>
		  <li> The set of <tt>hyp</tt>s used by the first two arguments
		  to <tt>cutAdmissible</tt> (the things that would correspond to
		  $\Gamma \prov A$ and $\Delta, A \prov C$) are
		  somehow <b>disjoint</b>
		  <li> The union of those two disjoint sets (which represents $\Gamma, \Delta$ together) is somehow
			 <b>the same as</b> &mdash; or, one might say, <b>shared with</b> &mdash; the <tt>hyp</tt>s used in the third argument to <tt>cutAdmissible</tt>, the
			 thing that would correspond to the proof of $\Gamma, \Delta \prov C$.
		</ol>
		Now the good news is that linear logic absolutely gives us ways
		to talk about disjointness and sharing! To be able to obtain $A \tensor B$
		is something like the ability to obtain $A$ and $B$
		from disjoint pools of resources, and to construct $A \& B$ is
		to be able to construct either one of $A$ or $B$ from the same
		set of resources.
	 </p>
	 <p>
		Bearing that in mind, Frank writes on the chalkboard:
		<tt class="code">
		  cutAdmissible : ((conc A $\tensor$ (hyp A $\lol$ conc C)) $\&$ conc C) $\lol$ type.
		</tt>
		which seems really slick and nice &mdash; just like higher-order
		abstract syntax uses binding in the metalanguage to simulate
		binding in an object language, here it looks like we can use linearity in the metalanguage
		to talk about linearity in the object language.
	 </p>
	 <p>
		The only problem is that it totally doesn't work! One obvious
		problem is that LLF didn't have $\tensor$ (even though CLF did)
		but it's not terrifically difficult to imagine working around
		that by coding up something kind of like $\tensor$ even without the
		elim rules working right &mdash; such a thing would probably be
		good enough for representing 'disjointness of resources' in the
		sense that <tt>cutAdmissible</tt> needs.
	 </p>
	 <p>
		Another obvious problem is that instead of the type family
		having a nice distinct set of arguments joined by $\to$, ending
		in <tt>type</tt>, it has just one arguent, which is a decently
		complicated beast. How are we to even <I>name</I> the subparts
		of it when we want to talk about logic programming input/output
		modes, and about which argument is supposed to get smaller when
		doing totality checking? Not at all impossible to address, but
		it sounds a little like an ergonomic nightmare.
	 </p>
	 <h3>Linear Dependency</h3>
	 <p>
		But the real kicker, the biggest obstacle, isn't either of
		these, but something more basic: we didn't know how to actually
		have kinds of the form $A \lol \rtype$ in the type theory
		without everything blowing up. If you try to have a dependent
		function type like $\Pi (x \hat : A) . B(x)$ where the bound
		variable appears in $B$, but is also supposed to be somehow
		linear, all kinds of weird phenomena pop up where the variable's
		double role as an expendable resource and as an index for other
		type families seem at odds with one another; the variable gets
		stranded on one side of a multiplicative context split, despite
		still being necessary on the other side to make a type make
		sense, and it's confusion everywhere you look.
	 <p>
	 </p>
		There has been work about linear dependency that's come out
		since, things like
		McBride's <a href="https://personal.cis.strath.ac.uk/conor.mcbride/pub/Rig.pdf">I
		Got Plenty o' Nuttin'</A> &mdash; but I'm still not sure they enable
		stating cut admissibility like the above. I'd love to be corrected
		if I'm wrong, though!
	 </p>
	 <p>
		Anyhow, I'm going continue by shamelessly discussing
		how <I>I</I> ended up thinking about the problem, and where it
		led me, because I do genuinely think it ended up in an
		interesting place.
	 </p>
	 <h2>To Be Continued</h2>
	 But not right now! This feels like a natural stopping point in the
	 story, which I'm going to try to break up into reasonably small
	 chunks so I don't put off writing because it's too much all at once.
	 <p>
		This is where I was in the middle of trying to work on my
		thesis, trying to imagine what sense could be made of $A \lol \rtype$.
		Next time I'm going to try to summarize what, looking
		back from the present, I think of as The Point of my thesis,
		which is a certain way of doing an end-run around the problems
		of linear dependency by disentangling the linearity of it from the dependency.
