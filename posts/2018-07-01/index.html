	 <h1>Focusing and Category Variables</h1>

	 On the one hand, it <I>is</I> the case that ends and coends seem to behave like
	 universal and existential quantifiers over category variables in various nice ways; you
	 get that two universal (or two existential) quantifiers commute
	 \[ \int_\alpha \int_\beta F(\alpha, \alpha, \beta, \beta) \cong \int_\beta \int_\alpha F(\alpha, \alpha, \beta, \beta)\]
	 \[ \int^\alpha \int^\beta F(\alpha, \alpha, \beta, \beta) \cong \int^\beta \int^\alpha F(\alpha, \alpha, \beta, \beta)\]
	 and also isomorphisms that resemble familiar logical equivalences  like
	 \[ \forall x . A \imp F(x) \prequiv A \imp \forall x . F(x) \qquad
	 \int_\alpha A \to\ F(\alpha, \alpha) \cong A \to \int_\alpha F(\alpha, \alpha)\]
	 \[
	 \exists x . A \lor F(x) \prequiv A \lor \exists x . F(x) \qquad
	 \int^\alpha A +\ F(\alpha, \alpha) \cong A + \int^\alpha F(\alpha, \alpha)\]
	 \[
	 \exists x . A \land F(x) \prequiv A \land \exists x . F(x) \qquad
	 \int^\alpha A \x\ F(\alpha, \alpha) \cong A \x \int^\alpha F(\alpha, \alpha)\]
	 But I made an important mistake when jumping to the conclusion
	 that I can just treat them logically as if they literally are
	 quantifiers with the usual intro and elim rules!
	 <p/>
	 <h2>A Failed Sequent Rule</h2>
	 A counterexample is the sequent $\forall L$ rule:
	 \[
	 \Gamma ,  A(t) \prov  B
	 \over
	 \Gamma ,  \forall \alpha . A(\alpha) \prov  B
	 \]
	 In fact, let's look at a very special case of this where the chosen term is just
	 another variable, and the context is just a single assumption:
	 \[
	 A(\beta) \prov  B(\beta)
	 \over
	 \forall \alpha . A(\alpha) \prov  B(\beta)
	 \]
	 The way I was thinking, this would be interpreted as the ability to somehow transform
	 \[
	 \displaystyle  \int_\beta A(\beta, \beta) \to  B(\beta, \beta) \qquad\qquad (*)
	 \]
	 into
	 \[
	 \displaystyle \int_\beta \left(\int_\alpha  A(\alpha, \alpha)\right) \to  B(\beta,  \beta) \qquad\qquad (**)
	 \]
	 For arbitrary functors $A, B : \C^\op \x \C \to \rset$. But this just isn't true!
	 Suppose $\C$ is the arrow category $a \to b$, and suppose $A$ and $B$ are the functors
	 <center><img src="diagram1.png"></center>
	 Observe that the body of $(*)$, which if I write it more carefully by
	 noting the variances of both variables, is the functor $\C^\op \x \C \to \rset$ given by
	 \[\lambda \bar \beta  \beta . A(\beta, \bar\beta) \to  B(\bar\beta, \beta)\]
	 is actually isomorphic to $A$ itself. There is exactly one element of
	 \[(\lambda \bar \beta  \beta .A(\beta, \bar\beta) \to  B(\bar\beta, \beta))(a, b) =
	 A(b, a) \to  B(a, b)\]
	 because $A(b, a)$ is empty, and therefore initial in $\rset$. Similarly, there are no elements of
	 \[(\lambda \bar \beta  \beta .A(\beta, \bar\beta) \to  B(\bar\beta, \beta))(b, a) =
	 A(a, b) \to  B(b, a)\]
	 because $A(a, b)$ is nonempty, while $B(b, a)$ is empty.
	 <p/>
	 This means that $(*)$ <i>is</I> inhabited, with a unique inhabitant; since to inhabit an end is to inhabit every element
	 of the diagonal in a consistent way, we are forced to pick the unique element of $A(a, a)$ and the unique element
	 of $A(b, b)$, and notice that they have consistent transport to the unique element of $A(a, b)$.
	 On the other hand, $(**)$ is the same as
	 \[
	 \displaystyle  \left(\int_\alpha  A(\alpha, \alpha)\right) \to  \left(\int_\beta B(\beta,  \beta)\right)
	 \]
	 We just argued that $\int_\alpha A(\alpha, \alpha)$ has one inhabitant, and now we observe that
	 $\int_\beta B(\beta, \beta)$ has <I>no</I> inhabitants: we are forced to pick the unique element
	 of $B(a, a)$ and of $B(b, b)$, but these do not have common transport into $B(a, b)$. So $(**)$
	 has no inhabitants, and the interpretation of $\forall L$ is unsound.
	 <h2>But What <I>Can</I> We Do?</h2>
	 The fact that this doesn't work came as a bit of a shock to me, since all throughout
	 <a href="http://jcreed.org/papers/phase.pdf">trying to interpret
		the semantics of substructural logics</a> with coends-and-ends, everything seemed to work just fine
	 according to my expectations that ends were $\forall$ and coends were $\exists$.
	 <p/>
	 Which is to say, $\forall L$ (and also $\exists R$) seem to work fine <I>as long as</I> the functors
	 involved or the proofs involved come in particular special patterns.
	 I think I'm just beginning to understand what those 'special patterns' are, and the neat thing is
	 they seem to line up very nicely with a focusing proof theory. I'm going to go ahead and write down
	 what I think the answer is, even though I haven't checked (much less mechanized, which would
	 give me actual confidence) every last little detail, so there may still be some mistakes here.

	 <h2>The Syntax</h2>

	 I think at the very end the shape of the thing I want to prove is this: if you take what mostly
	 resembles ordinary focused first-order logic with a few wrinkles, then it has a sound interpretation
	 where every $\forall$ is an end and every $\exists$ is a coend.
	 <p/>

	 The wrinkle has to do with the co/contravariance of uses of category
	 variables (the things we're thinking of as the 'terms' of our
	 first-order logic) in propositions/types. Specifically, when
	 we <I>blur focus on a proposition</I>, we want to require that certain category variables
	 are used <I>with only one variance</I>, either co- or contravariant. Call such propositions
	 <I>univariant</I>, to contrast with <I>bivariant</I>.

	 <p/>Ultimately, I think
	 I need to keep track of which variables have already been substituted for with either the $\forall L$
	 or $\exists R$, but to keep the explanation simple, I'm just going to act as if there is only one
	 variable $\alpha : \C$ around that we care about.

	 <h2>The Semantics</h2>

	 On the semantic side, we are still going to interpret an unfocused sequent

	 \[\alpha : \C ; \Gamma \prov A \]

	 as an end

	 \[\int_\alpha \Gamma(\alpha, \alpha) \to A(\alpha, \alpha) \]

	 Actually, now is as good a time as any to switch to a slightly more compact notation
	 \[\int_\alpha \Gamma^\alpha_\alpha \to A^\alpha_\alpha \]
	 where I'll consistently write the contravariant argument to a bifunctor $\C^\op \x \C \to \rset$ as a superscript,
	 and the covariant argument as a subscript.
	 <h3>Focused Ends</h3>

	 However, if we have focusing in the syntax, we need to explain what it means to interpret a focused sequent like
	 \[ \Gamma \prov [P] \qquad \textrm{or} \qquad \Gamma[N] \prov Q\]

	 So I'm going to define a pair of generalizations of ends, the 'focused ends': a left-focused end
	 \[\int_\alpha [F^\alpha_\alpha] \to G^\alpha_\alpha \]
	 and a right-focused end
	 \[ \int_\alpha G^\alpha_\alpha \to [F^\alpha_\alpha] \]
	 An inhabitant
	 \[M : \int_\alpha [F^\alpha_\alpha] \to G^\alpha_\alpha \]
	 of a left-focused end is a family of functions
	 \[M_f : F^d_e \to G^d_e\]
	 one for each morphism $f : d \to e \in \C$, such that the following diagram commutes:
	 <center><img src="diagram2.png"></center>
	 An inhabitant
	 \[M : \int_\alpha G^\alpha_\alpha \to F^\alpha_\alpha \]
	 of the right-focused end is a family of functions
	 \[M_f : G^d_e \to F^d_e\]
	 one for each morphism $f : d \to e \in \C$, such that the following diagram commutes:
	 <center><img src="diagram3.png"></center>
	 <p/>
	 Given these definitions, we can define the meaning of focused sequents over one category
	 variable as
	 \[ \Gamma \prov [P] = \int_\alpha \Gamma^\alpha_\alpha \to [P^\alpha_\alpha]\]
	 \[ \Gamma[N] \prov Q = \int_\alpha  [N^\alpha_\alpha] \to (\Gamma^\alpha_\alpha \to Q^\alpha_\alpha)\]

	 <h2>Focus Rules</h2>
	 We'd like to check
	 \[
	 {\Gamma [N] \prov Q
	 \over
	 \Gamma , N \prov Q
	 }
	 \qquad
	 {\Gamma \prov [P]
	 \over
	 \Gamma  \prov P
	 }
	 \]
	 are sound. This is something we intended anyway: to check that the definition
	 of focused ends is in fact logically stronger
	 than ends as intended.
	 We claim there is a canonical map
	 \[\left(\int_\alpha [F^\alpha_\alpha] \to G^\alpha_\alpha\right) \to \left(\int_\alpha F^\alpha_\alpha \to G^\alpha_\alpha\right)\]
	 Recall that to be member of the ordinary end
	 \[\int_\alpha F^\alpha_\alpha \to G^\alpha_\alpha\] is to be a family of elements
	 $N_d : F^d_d \to G^d_d$ for every object $d\in\C$ such that, for any morphism $f : d \to e \in \C$, we have
	 \[(G_f \o N_d \o F^f = G^f \o N_e \o F_f ): F^e_d \to G^d_e \]
	 but if we have
	 \[M : \int_\alpha [F^\alpha_\alpha] \to G^\alpha_\alpha \]
	 then we can define
	 \[N_d = M_{1_d} \]
	 and calculate
	 \[G_f \o N_d \o F^f = G_f \o M_{1_d} \o F^f\]
	 \[= M_f \o F_f \o F^f\]
	 \[= M_f \o F^f \o F_f \]
	 \[= G^f \o M_{1_e} \o F_f\]
	 \[= G^f \o N_e \o F_f\]
	 exactly as required. The proof that a right-focused end implies an end, i.e.
	 \[\left(\int_\alpha G^\alpha_\alpha \to [F^\alpha_\alpha] \right)\to \left(\int_\alpha G^\alpha_\alpha \to F^\alpha_\alpha\right)\]
	 is symmetric.
	 <h2>Blur Rules</h2>
	 <h3> Unsound Version</h3>
	 Blur rules that allow a general bivariant proposition to be blurred
	 are <I>unsound</I>: for example the left blur
	 \[
	 {\Gamma, P \prov Q
	 \over
	 \Gamma [\ups P] \prov Q
	 }
	 \]
	 would be interpreted as
	 \[
	 {\displaystyle \int_\alpha P^\alpha_\alpha \to (\Gamma \to N)^\alpha_\alpha
	 \over
	 \displaystyle\int_\alpha [P^\alpha_\alpha] \to (\Gamma \to N)^\alpha_\alpha
	 }
	 \]
	 and if we look back to the counterexample up above in "A Failed Sequent Rule", and
	 we let $P = A$ and $N = B$ and let $\Gamma$  be empty, then we are trying to get from
	 $\int_\alpha A^\alpha_\alpha \to B^\alpha_\alpha$ (which we know to be the same
	 as $\int_\alpha A^\alpha_\alpha$, which is a singleton) to
	 $\int_\alpha [A^\alpha_\alpha] \to B^\alpha_\alpha$, which requires us to choose a map
	 $A^d_e \to B^d_e$ &mdash; that is, a map $1 \to 2$ &mdash; which is simultaneously
	 constrained to pick one element of $2$, and also the other. Since we can't,
	 $\int_\alpha [A^\alpha_\alpha] \to B^\alpha_\alpha$ is empty, and the interpretation
	 of this rule is unsound.
	 <h3>Sound Version</h3>
	 However, we <I>can blur univariant propositions</I>. We can soundly include the rules
	 \[
	 {\Gamma, P \prov Q \qquad P\ \textrm{covariant}
	 \over
	 \Gamma [\ups P] \prov Q
	 }
	 \qquad
	 {\Gamma, P \prov Q \qquad P\ \textrm{contravariant}
	 \over
	 \Gamma [\ups P] \prov Q
	 }
	 \]
	 \[
	 {\Gamma \prov N \qquad N\ \textrm{covariant}
	 \over
	 \Gamma \prov [\dns N]
	 }
	 \qquad
	 {\Gamma \prov N \qquad N\ \textrm{contravariant}
	 \over
	 \Gamma \prov [\dns N]
	 }
	 \]
	 Let's look at the first of these four; it interprets as
	 \[
	 {\displaystyle \int_\alpha P_\alpha \to (\Gamma \to Q)^\alpha_\alpha
	 \over
	 \displaystyle\int_\alpha [P_\alpha] \to (\Gamma \to Q)^\alpha_\alpha
	 }
	 \]
	 We assume that we have an element of the end
	 \[L \in \int_\alpha P_\alpha \to (\Gamma \to Q)^\alpha_\alpha\]
	 so
	 \[L_e \in P_e \to (\Gamma \to Q)^e_e\]
	 and we want to construct an element of the focused end
	 \[M \in \int_\alpha [P_\alpha] \to (\Gamma \to Q)^\alpha_\alpha\]
	 so we need
	 \[M_f : P_e \to (\Gamma \to Q)^d_e\]
	 so we define
	 \[M_f = (\Gamma \to Q)^f \o L_e\]
	 and we do a little diagram-chase to confirm that $M$ is a left focused end:
	 <center><img src="diagram4.png"></center>
	 where the left half of the diagram is the end-property of $L$.
	 <h2>Focused Identity Rule</h2>
	 We can also terminate a proof by finding a matching partner for a proposition under focus,
	 <I>even if that proposition is bivariant</I>. We can include the rules
	 \[
	 {\over \Gamma, P \prov [P]}
	 \qquad
	 {\over \Gamma[N] \prov N}
	 \]
	 which interpret as
	 \[
	 {\over \displaystyle \int_\alpha \Gamma^\alpha_\alpha \x P^\alpha_\alpha \to [P^\alpha_\alpha]}
	 \qquad
	 {\over \displaystyle\int_\alpha [N^\alpha_\alpha] \to(\Gamma \to N)^\alpha_\alpha}
	 \]
	 And if we define the right- and left-focused ends
	 \[L_f(g, p) = p \qquad R_f(n) = \lambda g . n \]
	 and then checking the focused end diagrams involves just commutative squares that have identities on half their sides,
	 because the $\Gamma$s are essentially not involved.
	 <h2>Focused Quantifier Rules</h2>
	 We finally come to the remediation of the problem we had at the beginning; we wish to validate synchronous
	 quantifier rules such as
	 \[
	 {
	 \Gamma, N(x) \prov Q
	 \over
	 \Gamma, [\forall x . N(x)] \prov Q
	 }
	 \qquad
	 {
	 \Gamma \prov P(x)
	 \over
	 \Gamma  \prov [\exists x . P(x)]
	 }
	 \]
	 which we interpret as
	 \[
	 {
	 \displaystyle\int_\beta \left[  N^\beta_\beta\right] \to (\Gamma\to Q)^\beta_\beta
	 \over
	 \displaystyle\int_\beta \left[\int_\alpha  N^\alpha_\alpha\right] \to (\Gamma\to Q)^\beta_\beta
	 }
	 \qquad
		 {
	 \displaystyle\int_\beta   \Gamma^\beta_\beta \to \left[  P^\beta_\beta\right]
	 \over
	 \displaystyle\int_\beta  \Gamma^\beta_\beta \to  \left[\int_\alpha  P^\alpha_\alpha\right]
	 }
	 \]

	 The thing that will save us is the stronger induction hypothesis that
	 we have not an inhabitant of a mere end, but a focused end. Let's consider the negative case:
	 we have
	 \[M : \displaystyle\int_\beta \left[  N^\beta_\beta\right] \to (\Gamma\to Q)^\beta_\beta\]
	 so
	 \[M_f :   N^d_e \to (\Gamma\to Q)^d_e\]
	 and we want to construct
	 \[L : \displaystyle\int_\beta \left[\int_\alpha  N^\alpha_\alpha\right] \to (\Gamma\to Q)^\beta_\beta\]
	 so
	 \[L :  \left(\int_\alpha  N^\alpha_\alpha\right) \to (\Gamma\to Q)^d_e\]
	 We therefore define
	 \[L_f(x) = M_f (N_f(x_d))\]
	 and chase the diagram
	 <center><img src="diagram5.png"></center>
	 to confirm that $L$ is a left-focused end, observing that cell $(1)$ is the end-property of the argument
	 $x$ to $L_f$, and cells $(2)$ and $(3)$ are the fact that $M$ is a left-focused end.
