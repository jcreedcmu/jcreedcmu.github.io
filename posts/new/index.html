	 <h1>Homoiconicity</h1>

	 The term "homoiconic", often used to describe lisps, was the target of some
	 interesting critique on twitter lately.
	 <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">That term doesn&#39;t seem to mean anything, though.</p>&mdash; ShriramKrishnamurthi (@ShriramKMurthi) <a href="https://twitter.com/ShriramKMurthi/status/1046904794466660355?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 1, 2018</a></blockquote>

	 (Click through for a long and interesting thread of discussion)
	 <p/>

	 I think it's great that the term is getting some scrutiny, though not
	 because I agree that it's <I>meaningless</I>... But I do think its
	 meaning --- or maybe I should even say, the potential different
	 meanings, plural, it could plausibly have --- are kind of muddled
	 and confusing, and deserve clarification.

	 <p/>
	 I'm going to try to answer a different question from "what is
	 homoiconicity?" because "what is X?" questions are always inherently a little
	 sketchy. Instead I'm going to think about the question:
	 <blockquote>
		Why does the experience of writing program-manipulating-programs
		(including but not limited to macros) in lisp feel special?
	 </blockquote>
	 I think there's two separable groups of reasons why:
	 <ol>
		<li>the type structure (!) of a typical lisp
		<li>the concrete syntax of a typical lisp
	 </ol>

	 Crucially, I'm not going to argue that lisps <I>are</I> special in
	 any distinct, black-and-white, all-or-nothing way. I think the
	 sense in which they feel special is a rather squishy matter of
	 pragmatics and convenience. Bringing back the h-word for just a
	 moment, I'd tend to think of "homoiconic" as a property more like
	 "elegant" or "user-friendly", rather than "type-sound" or
	 "turing-complete". But I think this way as a consequence of the
	 arguments below, so let me set up some context so that I can
	 argue them.

	 <h1>Type Structure: Junk, Noise</h1>

	 Free algebras on theories
	 are <a href="https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/course/80-413-713/notes/chap01.pdf">sometimes
	 characterized informally</a> by saying they have "no junk" and "no
	 noise". For example, the free monoid on the list $[a,b,c]$ has as
	 elements <I>only the things</I> that can be built from $a, b, c$
	 and the monoid operations ("no junk") and <I>the only equations
	 that hold</I> between them are those mandated by the monoid laws
	 ("no noise"). For example, $ab$ and $ba$ are distinct elements of
	 the free monoid, because we didn't postulate commutativity.

	 <p/> What's the type of 'programs'? Can the type of programs be
	 represented in your favorite blub language?
	 <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">s = &quot;int main(){return 0;}&quot;<br>s[0]<br>I just quoted a &quot;term&quot; and then used ordinary vector accessors to inspect it. That code is in C/Java/… whatever you want to translate it into. Seems to meet your definition. »</p>&mdash; ShriramKrishnamurthi (@ShriramKMurthi) <a href="https://twitter.com/ShriramKMurthi/status/1047189566669635585?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 2, 2018</a></blockquote>

	 Krishnamurthi correctly points out that there's no obstacle to
	 representing C programs in C. And just as surely we could represent lisp
	 programs in lisp strings also:
	 <blockquote>
		<tt>(setq f "(lambda (x y) (+ y (* y x)))")</tt>
	 </blockquote>
	 Why do we think of
	 <blockquote>
		<tt>(setq f '(lambda (x y) (+ y (* y x))))</tt>
	 </blockquote>
	 as a <I>better</I> representation?
	 <p/>

	 I claim it's because
	 <blockquote>
	 it has <I>less</I> junk and <I>less</I> noise
	 </blockquote> with respect to some ideal
	 notion of program.
	 <p/>

	 Let me back up and articulate more clearly what I need from the two
	 representations in play. The 'ideal programs' I'm talking about
	 can be thought of perhaps
	 as lambda-calculus terms
	 or something, up to $\alpha\beta\eta$-equality &mdash; or
	 JIT-compiled versions of the functions &mdash; the precise choice
	 here I don't think matters for my argument, but I could be wrong)
	 <p/>
	 Now both the representations are going to be <I>partial functions</I>
	 from some type to the type of ideal programs.

	 The domain type of this function is either
	 strings (in the case of the string representation)
	 or arbitrary data values in some imaginary lisp implementation (in the
	 case of the 'sexp representation').

	 <p/>
	 Having said that, we can observe

	 <ul><li>
		  The sexp rep'n
			 has <b>less junk</b> than the string rep'n,<br> in the sense that
		  there are lots of strings that aren't even valid sexps,
		  for example,
		  <blockquote><tt>")((( lambda + + [ /"</tt></blockquote>
		  However, every lisp value does have a way of writing it as a string,
		  at least, mumble mumble footnote mumble, if what I mean
		  by "lisp value" is limited to "atom or cons cell of two lisp values".
		<li>The sexp rep'n
		  has <b>less noise</b> than the string rep'n,<br> in the sense that
		  there are lots of strings that denote the same lisp value, for example
		  <blockquote><pre>(      lambda

   (x        y) (   + y x))</pre></blockquote>
		  and
		  <blockquote><tt>(lambda(x y)(+ y x))</tt></blockquote>
	 </ul>
	 However, it's still true of the sexp representation that
	 <ul>
		<li> It has <b>some junk</b> in the form of programs like
		  <blockquote><tt> (lambda (x) y)</tt></blockquote>
		  that use variables that haven't been bound
		  (and you could maybe also argue that permitting intuitively obviously
		  type-incorrect expressions like <tt>(+ "string" 42)</tt> is a form of "junk",
		  but to say that would be poking a much larger hornet's nest ;)
		<li> It has <b>some noise</b> in the sense that it doesn't equate
		  $\alpha$-equivalent programs, like
		  <blockquote><tt> (lambda (x) x)</tt></blockquote>
		  and
		  <blockquote><tt> (lambda (y) y)</tt></blockquote>
		  (and you could maybe also argue that failure to equate up to $\beta$
		  and $\eta$ is also a form of "noise")
	 </ul>
	 <h2>So what do lisps give you, in terms of type structure?</h2>
	 <center><img src="diagram.png"></center>
A typical lisp gives you
	 <ul>
		<li> a choice of a type,
		  what I've been calling 'lisp values' but which differs in its
		  precise details from language to language, but which is <b>somewhat
			 nearer to</b> the ideal type of programs in the programmer's mind,
		  in the sense of having somewhat less junk and less noise.
		<li> (partial) functions which convert this type to and from strings,
		  and which convert it to executable functions, in such a way
		  that they're <b>ergonomically rather
	 easy</b> to invoke &mdash; they either have really basic names like
	 <tt>read</tt> and probably don't require any module-import boilerplate
	 to use,
	 or are baked into the quoting-unquoting-evaluation mechanisms of the language.

	 </ul>
	 Note how squishy and nonabsolute these claims are! There's lots of
	 ways you could pick types to be a bit closer to Actual Programs. Has
	 anyone ever made something that feels like a lisp variant, except
	 there's designated syntax for variable binding sites, and and alpha-conversion
	 is quotiented out somehow? I've thought about that quite a few times over
	 the years... Indeed, let me call out as another advantage that

	 <ul>

		<li> The type of 'lisp values' is <b>fairly simple</b>, in terms
		  of gut-level kolmogorov-ish complexity. To say just $\mu \alpha.
		  \mathsf{atom} + \alpha * \alpha$ is a blatant
		  oversimplification for any real-world lisp &mdash; you probably also
		  want to include strings, characters, numbers, vectors, who knows what else &mdash;
		  but it's probably a lot more simple and uniform than the type that <I>more precisely</I>
		  (read: "with even less junk") describes the algebraic data type of, for example,
		  ocaml programs.
	 </ul>

	 This is to emphasize even further that I think what's going on here is a <b>trade-off</b>,
	 not an on-off switch of homoiconic-or-not.

	 <h2>What do lisps give you, in terms of concrete syntax?</h2>

	 The remaining part of the picture I know less about, because I'm
	 not that serious of a lisp macro hacker, but I think there's another
	  bullet point or two to add about macros, or at least about the
	 choice of concrete syntax, i.e. the choice of the particular
	 functions that go between 'values' and the type <tt>string</tt>.
	 Otherwise, the advantages I've claimed above would also be satisfied
	 by any language that comes with a good standard (un)parsing library,
	 with a lisp-esque type for the AST.

	 <p/> So let me add that what a lisp gives you is
	 <ul>
		<li> The mapping between the type of 'lisp values' and strings is also
		  <b>fairly simple</b>, yadda yadda gut-level kolmogorov complexity, footnote mumble
		  subjective
		  de gustibus non disputandum etc.
		  The strength of this advantage also decreases gradually in proportion to the number
		  of exotic features (read: 'branches in the recursive sum type that is lisp values')
		  you cram into your lisp. But I think all the hallmarks of lisp syntax
		  &mdash; the reuse of parentheses for block structure
		  and for expression grouping, and making absolutely every operation prefix &mdash;
		  has some advantages in terms of actual human brains having a couple fewer things to learn.
		  (but also disadvantages, at times,
		  in terms of actual human brains having less redundant information
		  to discriminate on. Though I came here to, er, praise caesar, not bury him...)
		<li> The concrete syntax of the language lets you easily <b>pass back and forth</b>
		  between building expressions
		  and invoking macro computations on expressions. I.e., quote, backtick/antiquote syntax,
		  and macros themselves.
	 </ul>
	 This latter point is again something that's not a Totally Unique Incomparable Advantage
	 of lisp, but worth thinking about by comparison to macros in C, and string interpolation syntax
	 in lots of languages.
