    <h1>Type Combinators for Interactive Forms</h1>

    I read <a href="https://eighty-twenty.org/2024/07/21/ui-for-sums-remembers-products">this
    blog post titled "UI for sums must remember products "</a>

    the other day, and I thought it was a really interesting idea. The
    core of it, I think, is the observation that the type of data that
    represents the state of a web form as you're editing it is not the
    same as the type of data that gets returned from a form when you
    submit it.
    <p>
      Just to copy the post's example here, if we have a form like
      <div class="ui-example">
        <input type="radio" checked="" /><label> Local project</label>
        <p><label>Project name:</label><input /></p>
        <input type="radio" /><label> Clone Git repository</label>
        <p><label>Git repository URL:</label><input /></p>
        <p><label>Access token:</label><input /></p>
        <p><label>Project name:</label><input /></p>
      </div>
      Then the type of the UI state while we're <b>editing</b> is something like the record type
(I'm going to use subscript $0$ for all the variables pertaining to this example)
<p>
      <div class="whitespace">$E_0 := \{$
    $projectType : \mathsf{Local} \celse \mathsf{Clone},$
    $localProjectName : \mathsf{str},$
    $gitRepoUrl : \mathsf{str},$
    $accessToken : \mathsf{str},$
    $clonedProjectName : \mathsf{str},$
$\}$</div>
<p>
Whereas the type of data that <b>results</b> when the user clicks the submit button is more
like a tagged union of two distinct record types:
      <div class="whitespace">$R_0 :=$
    $\celse \mathsf{Local}\ \{\ localProjectName : \mathsf{str}\ \}\  $
    $\celse \mathsf{Cloned}\ \{$
        $gitRepoUrl : \mathsf{str},$
        $accessToken : \mathsf{str},$
        $clonedProjectName : \mathsf{str},$
    $\}$</div>

      So although the "eventual type" of the data we're editing is $(\mathsf{str}) + (\mathsf{str} \x \mathsf{str} \x \mathsf{str})$,
      the "editing type" is actually something like $2 \x \mathsf{str} \x (\mathsf{str} \x \mathsf{str} \x \mathsf{str})$.

      <h3>Defining Form-Types</h3>
      In the blog post above, the author notes correctly that although it seems intuitive that we should turn
      $A + B$ into $2 \x A \x B$, it doesn't seem correct to naively apply this recursively.
      $(A + B) + C$ would turn into $(2 \x A \x B) + C$, and thence to $2 \x (2 \x A \x B) \x C$, which appears
      to have too many choices in it! What we really wanted was $3 \x A \x B \x C$.
      <p>
        So I asked myself: if there isn't a binary operation
        on <b>types</b> that associates how we want, is there an
        operation on "something more than types"?
      <p>
        Here's the answer I came up with: briefly, "yes, an operation on 3-tuples of types with a function".
        Define a "form-type" to be a tuple $(C, P, R, f)$ where $C, P, R$ are types, and $f : C \x P \to R$.
        This can represent the type of an individual form element, or a larger form made of multiple elements.
        The intuitions for these are:
<ul>
<li> $C$ is the type of <b>choices</b> that need to be made in order for the form to be submittable. In the example, we say $C = C_0 := \mathsf{Local} \celse \mathsf{Clone} \cong 2$.
<li> $R$ is the <b>result</b> type, the type of data our program gets at the very end when the form is submitted.
In the running example, we say $R = R_0$ as defined above.
<li> $P$ is the type of <b>partially used data</b> across all choices. In the example above, we set
$P = P_0$ where we define
      <div class="whitespace">$P_0 := \{$
    $localProjectName : \mathsf{str},$
    $gitRepoUrl : \mathsf{str},$
    $accessToken : \mathsf{str},$
    $clonedProjectName : \mathsf{str},$
$\}$</div>
Notice that $E_0 = C_0 \x P_0$.
<li> $f$ is a function that tells us how to compute $R$ from $C \x P$. In the example, it is pretty
easy to imagine how we compute $R_0$ from $C_0 \x P_0$: we case-match on the value of type $C_0$,
and project out whichever fields we need from $P_0$ in order to construct an element of the sum type $R_0$.
</ul>

<h3>Combinators for Building Form Types</h3>

Here's how we can build up form types. A simple text box is the form type
$\overline{\mathsf{str}} = (1, \mathsf{str}, \mathsf{str}, \lambda \ll c,p\rr . p)$. There are no interesting choices to be made,
so the choice type is the unit type. The data to be edited is string, and the data to be returned is string.
<p>
We now define two binary operations $\oplus$, and $\otimes$, each taking two form types and yielding a form type.
They can be thought of as "disjunctive" and "conjunctive" ways of combining forms, but I'm not claiming they're the
coproduct or product in any particular category right now.
<p>
The operation $\oplus$ is defined by saying
<div class="whitespace">
\((C_1, P_1, R_1, f_1) \oplus (C_2, P_2, R_2, f_2) = (\)
    $C_1 + C_2,$
    $P_1 \x P_2,$
    $R_1 + R_2,$
    $\lambda \ll c, \ll p_1, p_2\rr\rr. \bb{case} c \bb{of}$
        $\celse (\bb{inl} c_1) \Rightarrow f_1\ll c_1, p_1\rr$
        $\celse (\bb{inl} c_2) \Rightarrow f_2\ll c_2, p_2\rr,$
\()\)
</div>

and the operation $\otimes$ is defined by saying
<div class="whitespace">
\((C_1, P_1, R_1, f_1) \otimes (C_2, P_2, R_2, f_2) = (\)
    $C_1 \x C_2,$
    $P_1 \x P_2,$
    $R_1 \x R_2,$
    $\lambda \ll\ll c_1, c_2\rr, \ll p_1, p_2\rr\rr. $
        $\ll f_1\ll c_1, p_1\rr,  f_2\ll c_2, p_2\rr \rr,$
\()\)
</div>

<h3>Associativity</h3>
Now we can revisit how this solves the "$3 \x A \x B \x C$ problem".
Let's say the "edit type" $\E(\hbox{---})$ of a form-type
is defined by $\E(C,P,R,f) := C \x P$.
Suppose we have form types with trivial choice-types $\ol X_i = (1, P_i, R_i, f_i)$ for $i \in \{1,2,3\}$.


<p>
Observe that $\E(\ol X_1 \oplus \ol X_2) = (1 + 1) \x (P_1 \x P_2) $, as expected, but also
 $\E((\ol X_1 \oplus \ol X_2) \oplus X_3) = (1 + (1 + 1)) \x (P_1 \x (P_2 \x P_3)) $, as desired.
<p>
More generally, if we had had  $\ol X_i = (C_i, P_i, R_i, f_i)$ for $i \in \{1,2,3\}$, then we would have
\[\E((\ol X_1 \oplus \ol X_2) \oplus X_3) = (C_1 + (C_2 + C_3)) \x (P_1 \x (P_2 \x P_3)) \]
which seems intuitively right to me.
      <h2>Validation</h2>
      This discrepancy between "edit types" and "result types" is even bigger if we consider input fields that have more complex validation.
      Suppose our form also had a numeric input, like:
    <div class="ui-example">
        <input type="radio" checked="" /><label> Local project</label>
        <p><label>Project name:</label><input /></p>
        <input type="radio" /><label> Clone Git repository</label>
        <p><label>Git repository URL:</label><input /></p>
        <p><label>Access token:</label><input /></p>
        <p><label>Project name:</label><input /></p>
        <p><label><b>Clone depth</b>:</label><input /></p>
      </div>
and suppose we want the user to be able to edit its ephemeral value as a string, and defer forcing validation until they try to submit.
This subtlety has actually come up for me implementing forms; if you try to make a react form and force the state to always be a number,
you can't fully delete the number that's there as a default before typing in your preferred value.
<p>
So in order to handle validation, we need to represent the possibility that validation fails!
<p>
So let's generalize form-types by including one more component type, for <B>errors</B>: a form type is now
a tuple $(C, P, R, E, f)$ where $C, P, R$ are types, and $f : C \x P \to R + E$. The act of submitting takes the choices $C$
<B>and</B> the partially used data $P$, and produces either a result $R$ <B>or</B> an error $E$.
<h3>Revising the definition of combinators</h3>
Now we can still define a sensible $\oplus$ and $\otimes$. We say:
<div class="whitespace">
\((C_1, P_1, R_1, E_1, f_1) \oplus (C_2, P_2, R_2, E_1, f_2) = (\)
    $C_1 + C_2,$
    $P_1 \x P_2,$
    $R_1 + R_2,$
    $E_1 + E_2,$
    $\lambda \ll c, \ll p_1, p_2\rr\rr. \bb{case} c \bb{of}$
        $\celse (\bb{inl} c_1) \Rightarrow \iota_1 (f_1\ll c_1, p_1)\rr$
        $\celse (\bb{inl} c_2) \Rightarrow \iota_2 (f_2\ll c_2, p_2)\rr,$
\()\)

</div>

and

<div class="whitespace">
\((C_1, P_1, R_1, E_1, f_1) \otimes (C_2, P_2, R_2, E_2, f_2) = (\)
    $C_1 \x C_2,$
    $P_1 \x P_2,$
    $R_1 \x R_2,$
    $E_1 + E_2,$
    $\lambda \ll\ll c_1, c_2\rr, \ll p_1, p_2\rr\rr. \bb{case} f_1\ll c_1, p_1\rr \bb{of} $
        $\celse (\bb{inr} e_1) \Rightarrow \iota_3(e_1)$
        $\celse (\bb{inl} r_1) \Rightarrow \bb{case} f_1\ll c_1, p_1\rr \bb{of} $
            $\celse (\bb{inr} e_2) \Rightarrow \iota_4(e_2)$
            $\celse (\bb{inl} r_2) \Rightarrow \bb{inl}(\ll r_1, r_2 \rr),$
\()\)

</div>

where <div class="whitespace">
$\iota_1 : (R_1 + E_1) \to (R_1 + R_2) + (E_1 + E_2)$
$\iota_2 : (R_2 + E_2) \to (R_1 + R_2) + (E_1 + E_2)$
$\iota_3 : E_1 \to (R_1 \x R_2) + (E_1 + E_2)$
$\iota_4 : E_2 \to (R_1 \x R_2) + (E_1 + E_2)$

</div>
are the obvious injections which seemed like they would be more confusing if written out explicitly.

<p>
Let us briefly note what's going on here. In the $\oplus$ of two forms,
<ul>
<li>the user has all the choices available in the one form, and the other; the $C$ are summed together.
<li>the user can edit all the constitutent data of one form, and the other; we take the product of their data $P$.
<li>when the time comes to submit and do validation, only the data that is selected by the "choices" gets validated,
and any errors that arise from it are propagated as errors of the whole form
</ul>
In the $\otimes$ of two forms,
<ul>
<li>the user must simultaneously make a choice in each of the choice sets of the two forms; the $C$ are multiplied together.
<li>the user can edit all the constitutent data of one form, and the other; we take the product of their data $P$.
<li>when the time comes to submit and do validation, both component pieces of data are validated, according to the
respective "choices". An error may arise from either or both subforms; however, if errors arise in both, we <b>asymmetrically</b>
report the error in the first, rather than the second. If we encounter no errors, we have results from both parts,
and so can propagate up a result.
</ul>
<h3>Open Question</h3>
It's not clear to me if it's possible, but it seems desirable if so &mdash; can this asymmetry be repaired somehow?
It seems otherwise so pleasant that $\oplus$ is "3/4s sum types" and $\otimes$ is "3/4s product types".
Connecting any of this to lenses or monads or anything also seems tantalizingly possible, but I don't yet see how.
