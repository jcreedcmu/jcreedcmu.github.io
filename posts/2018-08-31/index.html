	 <h1>Orienting Simplices</h1>

	 Suppose I have $n$ points in $\R^{n-1}$. For example, 3 points in $\R^2$.
	 <p/>
	 If I think of these as objects in a 2-category, and I think
	 of the $x$-direction of $\R^2$ as representing 'the flow of time as far
	 as the 1-cells are concerned', and the $y$-direction as 'the flow
	 of time as far as the 2-cells are concerned', then there's two possible sorts
	 of 2-cell that these points (together with the lines and triangle that lie between them) can represent. One where two morphisms 'compose'
	 across the 2-cell to yield a third, and one where one 'decomposes' into two morphisms.
	 <center><img src="diagram.png"></center>
	 More precisely, I want to observe the following things:
	 There is a <I>categorical</I> sense in which every cell lies
	 either in the domain or codomain of the higher-dimensional cells
	 it's part of. For example, $a$ is in the domain of $h$, $b$ is in the codomain of $g$, $h$ is in the codomain of $\alpha$,
	 $f$ and $g$ are both in the domain of $\alpha$, $k$ is in the codomain of $\beta$, etc.
	 <p/>
	 But there is also  a <I>geometric</I> sense in which we can take any cell
	 and ask whether it looks like it's in the domain or codomain of a higher dimensional cell.
	 For example, to ask whether $h$ is in the codomain of $\alpha$, we ask
	 whether
	 \[\det\left(\begin{matrix}a_x & a_y & 1 \\ c_x & c_y & 1 \\ b_x & b_y & 1
	 \end{matrix}\right) &lt; 0
	 \]
	 at least assuming the points are laid out as depicted, with $c_x - a_x$.
	 <p/>
	 In general, if we have  points $q, p^1, \ldots, p^n$ in $\R^{n}$ then
	 \[\det\left(\begin{matrix}
	 p^1_1 & p^1_2 & \cdots & p^1_{n} & 1\\
	 p^2_1 & p^2_2 & \cdots & p^2_{n} & 1\\
	 \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots & \vdots \\
	 p^n_1 & p^n_2 & \cdots & p^n_{n} & 1\\
	 q_1 & q_2 & \cdots & q_{n} & 1
	 \end{matrix}\right)
	 \over
	 \det\left(\begin{matrix}
	 p^1_1 & p^1_2 & \cdots & p^1_{n-1} & 1\\
	 p^2_1 & p^2_2 & \cdots & p^2_{n-1} & 1\\
	 \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots & \vdots \\
	 p^n_1 & p^n_2 & \cdots & p^n_{n-1} & 1
	 \end{matrix}\right)
	 \]
	 is how far $q$ is &mdash; in the $n$-coordinate &mdash; from the hyperplane determined by $p^1, \ldots, p^n$.
	 Thus, this will be positive if it's on the `positive $n$-coordinate side' of the hyperplane,
	 and negative for the other.
	 <p/>
	 So if we have a large sequence of points $S = (S^1, \ldots, S^m) \in (\R^\infty)^m$, then
	 we can extract some coarse information about how they are shaped, as some data
	 of type
	 \[\Pi n &lt; m. \Pi K : \mathcal P_n(S). \Pi q \in (S \setminus K) . \{\dom, \cod\} \]
	 That is, for any $n &lt; m$ and any $n$-sized subset $p^1, \ldots p^n \subseteq S$ and some
	 $q \in S \setminus  p^1, \ldots, p^n $ not already in that subset,
	 we can project each of the $p^1, \ldots, p^n, q$ from $\R^\infty$ down to just $\R^n$ by
	 taking their first $n$ coordinates, and ask
	 whether the sign of the expression is above is positive or negative. We interpret this
	 as telling us whether the $(n-1)$-cell determined by $p^1, \ldots p^n$ is in the domain
	 or codomain of the $n$-cell determined by $q, p^1, \ldots p^n$.
	 <p/>
	 <h2>Question</h2>
	 For each $m$, how many distinct such functions can actually be attained by a suitable
	 choice of $m$ points $S$? Call this $\phi(m)$.
	 <p/>
	 I know $\phi(1) = 1$ and $\phi(2) = 2$ and $\phi(3) = 12$, (because of the two triangle diagrams
	 above, plus a factor of $3!$ for permutations of merely in which order the three vertices appear in $S$)
	 and I think $\phi(4) = 576 = 4! \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 6$, because of a choice of permutation
	 of the 4 vertices, a  choice of how to flip all the 2-cells, a  choice
	 of how to flip the 3-cell, and the fact that 6 of the following 8 diagrams
	 <center><img src="diagram2.png"></center>
	 seem 'consistent' with a
	 downward-pointing 2-cell going 'out of the page' from the top 1-cell of each little
	 diagram to the bottom 1-cell. Where 'consistency' means that there is a 'least' and 'greatest'
	 1-path.

	 But I'm less confident about that.
