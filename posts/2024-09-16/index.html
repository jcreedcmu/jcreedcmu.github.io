    <h1>Naive Topology Intuitions and Logic</h1>

    While playing around a bit with CAD programs lately, I realize I
    have two separate &mdash; and potentially contradictory! &mdash;
    bundles of intuitions about shapes in space ought to undergo
    unions and intersections.

    <h3>Shapes to a Topologist</h3>
    One I'll call the "topologist" idea of shape. A shape is a subset of $\R^n$,
    and unions are set-theoretic unions, and intersections are set-theoretic intersections.
    <h3>Naive Shapes</h3>
    The other I'll call the "naive" idea of shape, but I don't mean that as an insult.
    It actually strikes me as quite natural. It's what I expect and get from CAD software that
    manipulates 3-d shapes. According to this intuition, if I take two equal-sized
    squares side-by-side,
    <ol>
      <li> If I compute their union, I should get a rectangle twice as wide as it is tall.
      <li> If I compute their intersection, I should get the empty shape.
    </ol>
    <center><img src="diagram.png"></center>

    <h3>The Problem</h3>
    Here's why this is at odds with the topologist's intuition: ask yourself, is
    the boundary of the square in the square? That is, are we dealing with an
    open square $(0,1) \x (0,1)$ or a closed square $[0,1] \x [0,1]$? If open,
    then the union of the two squares $(0,1) \x (0,1) \cup (1,2) \x (0,1)$
    is not the rectangle $(0,2) \x (0,1)$. If closed, then the intersection
    of the two squares is not empty!
    <h3>A Solution I Don't Like</h3>

    We could say that the squares are products of half-open intervals like
    $[0,1) \x [0,1)$, and that would make this particular example
    work, (in the sense that conditions (1) and (2) above are
    satisfied) but it's ugly and asymmetric, and I'm not sure if
    there's any sensible story to tell about rotation. Surely at least
    saying the rotation of a shape is the pointwise rotation of the
    points belonging to it can no longer be the case, since this would
    break the half-open-in-the-correct-direction invariant that we're
    tacitly introducing.

    <h3>A Solution I Like</h3>
    My goal is to give some formal account of what the "Naive Shapes" idea
    is saying. I feel like a core part of it is believing that
    <blockquote> If I try to ask whether the boundary of these shapes "belongs to" the shapes
        or not, this is <em>a meaningless question</em></blockquote>

    So I want to do something like quotienting out by the presence or
    absence of boundary points. Alternatively, I can think of it as
    picking out a subset of the possible shapes that are
    "well-behaved", which excludes lower-dimensional shapes like the
    single face that is the intersection of two squares sitting next
    to each other. Then the operation of taking their intersection is
    modified to instead be finding the "best approximation to their
    intersection by a <em>well-behaved</em> shape"

    <h3>Well-Behaved Shapes</h3>
    After some rumination, I decided that a definition I like is:

    <blockquote>
      A subset of $\R^n$ is well-behaved if it is equal to the interior of its closure.
    </blockquote>

    because this means the set itself is open, and also doesn't have any weird "holes"
    that closure would have repaired.

    <h3>Cut off by LLM</h3>
    I had a longer bit of explanation and proof planned for this post, but then I popped
    <blockquote>
      Is there a standard name for the property of a subset X of a topological space where X is equal to the interior of its closure?
    </blockquote>
    into ChatGPT, and it turns out this is in fact a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_open_set">well-known property of subsets
    of a topological space</a>: the property is called being <b>regular open</b>.

    <p/> The interesting fact is that these do form a complete boolean
    algebra. Being regular open is preserved by intersection, and
    although it isn't preserved by union or complementation , you can
    define a "corrected union"
    \[ A \sqcup B = \mathrm{Int}(\mathrm{Clo}(A \cup B))\]
    and a "corrected complement"
    \[ {\sim}A = \mathrm{Int}(\mathrm{Clo}(X \setminus A))\]
    and these are the appropriate operations for the boolean algebra.
    <h3>The Logical View</h3>
    I notice the definition of regular open is the same as something that smells a lot
    like (although I suppose it's strictly stronger than) the axiom that characterizes
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S5_(modal_logic)">the modal logic S5 </a>:
    if we interpret Int as $\square$ and Clo as $\dia$ in a classical modal logic interpreted
    into a topological space, then we're requiring
    \[ A \dashv\vdash \square \dia A \]
    So, $A$ being true here is the same as A always eventually being true.
    <p/>

    Or to see it another way, we're basically picking out the
    double-negation-stable propositions from an intuitionistic point
    of view, where (intuitionistic) negation is interpreted into modal
    logic as $\sq \lnot$, and asking for
    \[ A \dashv\vdash \square \lnot \square\lnot A \]
    is just asking that $A$ is equivalent to its intuitionistic double-negation.
