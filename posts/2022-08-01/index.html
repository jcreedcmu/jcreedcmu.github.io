    <title>Jacobi Triple Product Identity</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Jacobi Triple Product Identity</h1>

    I really liked <a href="https://andrewodesky.com/res/jtp_v2.1.pdf"> this
    exposition</a> of a combinatorial &mdash; and very physics-flavored &mdash; proof of the Jacobi Triple
    Product Identity, so I thought I'd try to tell the story in my own
    words, with some more pictures.

    <h2>The Dirac Sea</h2>
    We start by imagining that we have an infinite collection of particles, but with the following
    constraints:
    <ul>
      <li>The particles are indistinguishable except for how much energy each one currently has.
      <li>No two particles can exist at the same state, i.e. with the same energy.
      <li>The only energy value a particle is allowed to have is an integer plus 1/2.
        For example, energies $-7/2, -5/2, -3/2, -1/2, 1/2, 3/2, 5/2, 7/2$ are allowed.
    </ul>
    Given these constraints, the state of our whole universe is given by answering the question,
    for each energy value $E \in \Z + {1\over 2}$, <i>does there exist a particle of energy $E$?</i>

    <p/>
    We add one more constraint:
    <ul>
      <li>The state of the whole collection of particles is only finitely different
        from the <i>ground state</i>, which we define to be this picture:
        <center><img src="dirac1.png"></center>
        That is, the ground state is one where we <i>do</I> have a particle at every negative
        energy, and we <i>don't</i> have a particle at every positive energy.
        <p/>

        We say that the total <i>energy</i> of the ground state is
        zero, and the total <i>particle count</i> is zero. Obviously
        based on what we just said, it seems like we have infinitely
        many particles, with infinitely negative energy &mdash; but we
        take the ground state as a baseline for both statistics.

    </ul>

    We may consider states with more particles at positive energies:
    <center><img src="dirac2.png"/></center>
    For example, we say that this state has two particles (because it
    has two <i>more</i> than the ground state) and it has energy
    ${1\over 2} + {3 \over 2} = 2$.
    <p/>

    We may also consider states with <i>fewer</i> particles at negative energies:
    <center><img src="dirac3.png"/></center>
    We say that this state has $-2$ particles (because it
    has two <i>fewer</i> than the ground state) and it has energy
    ${1\over 2} + {5 \over 2} = 3$. It has positive energy because we've <i>removed</i>
    particles that had negative energy.
    <p/>

    We may also add <i>and</i> remove particles, as long as we only add and remove finitely many:
    <center><img src="dirac4.png"/></center>
    We say that this state has particle count zero (because it
    has just as many as the ground state &mdash; one particle and one 'hole'/'antiparticle')
    and it has energy
    ${7\over 2} + {3 \over 2} = 5$.

    <h2>First Generating Function</h2>
    Now we want to try writing a generating function for the set of all allowable
    states, indexed by their particle count and energy. Recall that a state is
    a way of answering the question,
    <blockquote>
    For every energy value $E \in \Z + {1\over 2}$, does there exist a particle of energy $E$?
    </blockquote>
    We can interpret the <I>For every</I> as a product, and the two possibilities &mdash;
    that either there does or does not exist a particle of energy $E$ &mdash; as a sum.
    Specifically, we might try to consider the product
    \[\prod_{E \in \Z + {1\over 2}} (1 + q^E z)\]
    which gives us a polynomial in $q$ and $z$, where we might try to interpret the coefficient
    of $q^E z^n$ as being the number of states with energy $E$ and particle count $n$.
    <p/>

    The problem with this expression is it effectively asserts that
    our ground state is having no particles at all: it allows for states with negative energies,
    whereas our examples above, with the ground state including occupants for all negative energy levels, all state energies are positive.

    <p/>Therefore we do the following not-quite-formal reasoning
    \[\prod_{E \in \Z + {1\over 2}} (1 + q^E z) = \prod_{m \ge 0} (1 + q^{m+{1\over 2}} z)(1 + q^{-m-{1\over 2}} z)\]
    \[ = \left(\prod_{m \ge 0} (1 + q^{m+{1\over 2}} z)\right)\left(\prod_{m\ge 0}(1 + q^{-m-{1\over 2}} z)\right)\]
    \[ = \left(\prod_{m \ge 0} (1 + q^{m+{1\over 2}} z)\right)\left(\prod_{m\ge 0}( q^{m+{1\over 2}} z^{-1} + 1)q^{-m-{1\over 2}} z\right)\]
    \[ = \left(\prod_{m \ge 0} (1 + q^{m+{1\over 2}} z)\right)\left(\prod_{m\ge 0}( q^{m+{1\over 2}} z^{-1} + 1)\right) \left(\prod_{m \ge 0} q^{-m-{1\over 2}} z\right)\]
    and renormalize by dropping the factor of $\left(\prod_{m \ge 0} q^{-m-{1\over 2}} z\right)$ (in other words: taking for granted that we do have infinitely many negative-energy particles) to obtain
    \[\left(\prod_{m \ge 0} (1 + q^{m + {1\over 2}} z)\right)\left(\prod_{m \ge 0} (1 + q^{m + {1\over 2}} z^{-1})\right)\]

    The coefficient of $q^E z^n$ in this infinite product is in fact the number of states finitely different from our chosen ground state with energy $E$ and particle count $n$.
    For each positive energy $m + {1\over 2}$, we can choose either to have a particle there (contributing $q^{m+{1\over 2}} z$ to the product, increasing total energy by $m+{1\over 2}$ and increasing particle
    count by 1) or not (trivially contributing 1 to the product).
    For each negative energy level, we can choose either to leave our ground state particle alone (trivially contributing 1), or to remove a particle of that energy, i.e.
    add an antiparticle at that energy, contributing $q^{m+{1\over 2}}z^{-1}$, increasing energy by $m+{1\over 2}$, and decreasing particle count by 1.

    <h2>Second Generating Function</h2> Another way we can account for
    how many states there are at each energy is by observing that for
    a chosen particle count (relative to the ground state), there is a
    minimum energy (relative to the ground state) that can be
    obtained: we just push all particles leftward until we can push them
    no farther. Consider the following example:
    <center><img src="dirac5.png"/></center>
    The particle that had energy $-{1\over 2}$ drops 1 spot to fill the $-{3\over 2}$ level.
    The particle that had energy ${5\over 2}$ drops 3 spots to fill the $-{1\over 2}$ level.
    The particle that had energy ${7\over 2}$ drops 3 spots to fill the ${1\over 2}$ level.
    <p/>

    This process effectively "standardizes" any state by mapping it to
    a state that looks just like the ground state, but perhaps shifted
    left or right on the energy scale. The information that is lost by
    this standardization process is exactly a <i>partition</i> of the
    number that counts how much total energy was lost. In this case, we lost a total of 7 units of energy, and the partition is $(3,3,1)$.

    <p/>
    What is the energy and particle count of the ground state shifted to the right $N$ spots?
    Since the sum of the first $N$ odd numbers is $N^2$, we see its energy is $N^2/2$,
    and the particle count is $N$. So in generating-function language, the "almost ground" states form the sum
    \[\sum_{N = -\infty}^\infty q^{N^2/2}z^N \]
    But we also have to consider the choice of partition with which we 'excite' particles from one of these states. Let $p(n)$ be the number of partitions of $n$. We
    now claim that an expression for the generating function of all possible states is:
    \[\sum_{n=0}^\infty p(n)q^n \sum_{N = -\infty}^\infty q^{N^2/2}z^N \]
    We first choose how much energy (i.e. $n$) is tied up in exciting particles above the almost-ground state. Then we choose a partition to describe how it is allocated,
    and choose which almost-ground state we're working from.
    <h2>Putting These Together</h2>
    We have two generating-function expressions that both purport to describe all possible states of our system. We set them equal:
       \[\left(\prod_{m \ge 0} (1 + q^{m + {1\over 2}} z)\right)\left(\prod_{m \ge 0} (1 + q^{m + {1\over 2}} z^{-1})\right)= \sum_{n=0}^\infty p(n)q^n \sum_{N = -\infty}^\infty q^{N^2/2}z^N \]
    Recall the product expression of the partition generating function:
       \[\left(\prod_{m \ge 0} (1 + q^{m + {1\over 2}} z)\right)\left(\prod_{m \ge 0} (1 + q^{m + {1\over 2}} z^{-1})\right)= \left(1\over \prod_{m=1}^\infty (1-q^m)\right)  \sum_{N = -\infty}^\infty q^{N^2/2}z^N \]
    And recall the standard $q$-Pochhammer notation:
    \[(a;q)_\infty = \prod_{m = 0}^\infty (1-aq^m)\]
    This lets us rewrite the above as
       \[(-q^{1\over 2}z;q)_\infty (-q^{1\over 2}z^{-1};q)_\infty = {1\over (q;q)_\infty} \sum_{N = -\infty}^\infty q^{N^2/2}z^N \]
    Finally, substituting $q = ab$ and $z = \sqrt{a/b}$, we can obtain the pleasantly symmetric form
       \[(-a;ab)_\infty (-b;ab)_\infty (ab;ab)_\infty =  \sum_{N = -\infty}^\infty a^{N(N+1)/2}b^{N(N-1)/2} \]

    <h2>A Direct Combinatorial Interpretation of the $ab$-expression</h2>
    Say a <i>unique off-diagonal partition</i> of the pair $(\ell, k)$ is a finite set of pairs $(\ell_i, k_i)$ such that $\ell = \sum_i\ell_i$ and $k = \sum_i k_i$
    and $|\ell_i - k_i| = 1$. Then the $a^\ell b^k$ coefficient of
    \[(-a;ab)_\infty (-b;ab)_\infty = \prod_{m=0}^\infty (1+a^{m+1}b^m)(1+a^mb^{m+1})\] is exactly the number of unique off-diagonal partitions
    of $(\ell, k)$.
    Consider what the equation
      \[(-a;ab)_\infty (-b;ab)_\infty (ab;ab)_\infty =  \sum_{N = -\infty}^\infty a^{N(N+1)/2}b^{N(N-1)/2} \]
      is effectively saying, if we move the $(ab;ab)_\infty$ back to the right hand side:
      \[\prod_{m=0}^\infty (1+a^{m+1}b^m)(1+a^mb^{m+1}) = \left(\sum_{n = 0}^\infty p(n)a^nb^n\right)  \left(\sum_{N = -\infty}^\infty a^{N(N+1)/2}b^{N(N-1)/2}\right) \]
    We should be able to bijectively  transform a unique off-diagonal partition of $(\ell, k)$ into a choice of $n$, an ordinary partition $\lambda$ of $n$, and a choice of $N$,
    such that
\[n + N(N+1)/2 = \ell\]
\[n + N(N-1)/2 = k\]
    <p/>
    Here is how we can do it. The parts of a unique off-diagonal partition are particles and anti-particles.
    Specifically, $a^{m+1}b^{m}$ plays the role of a particle of energy $m+1/2$, and $a^{m}b^{m+1}$ plays the role of an antiparticle of energy $m+1/2$.
    We set
\[n = {\ell + k - (\ell - k)^2 \over 2}\]
\[N = \ell - k \]
And extracting the partition works analogously: we can see that a $a^mb^{m+1}$ actually does behave like a 'missing' $a^{m+1}b^m$, as long as we have
a big enough $a^{N(N+1)/2}b^{N(N-1)/2}$ 'sea' to borrow from.
