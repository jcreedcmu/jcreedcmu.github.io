	 <h1>Two Warping Operations</h1> A couple of interesting papers
	 showed up at <a href="https://lics.siglog.org/lics18/">LICS</a> a
	 couple of weeks ago, which used almost exactly the same technical
	 device to solve rather different problems. I don't have much
	 intelligent to say about them, but I think it's worth giving at
	 least a passing thought to whether the coincidence is significant
	 in some deeper way. <p/>
	 <h2>Warping Time</h2>

	 The first one is "<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.11021">A
    Generalized Modality for Recursion</a>"
    by <a href="http://ludics.eu/~guatto/">Adrien Guatto</a>. The
    topic is the modal type theory appropriate for reasoning about,
    specifically guaranteeing productivity of, guarded recursion. The
    standard thing to do
    (see <a href="https://www.irif.fr/~mellies/papers/modalmodel-popl2007.pdf">here</a>
    or <a href="http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~vezzosi/vezzosi-lic.pdf">here</a>)
    is to have a "later" modality called $\next$, so that you can say
    that the only way to make fixpoints is something like \[ \Gamma, x
    : \next \tau \prov e : \tau \over \Gamma \prov \mathbf{fix}\ x.e :
    \tau \] instead of the unrestricted fixpoint that has the same
    rule without the $\next$.

	 <p/>The other things we can do with $\next$ include injecting unmodalized types into it:
	 \[
	 \Gamma \prov e : A
	 \over
	 \Gamma \prov \mathrm{next}\ e : \next A
	 \]
	 and we can lift functions:
	 \[
	 \Gamma \prov e : \next (A \to B)
	 \qquad
	 \Gamma \prov e' : \next A
	 \over
	 \Gamma \prov e * e' : \next B
	 \]
	 That is, $\next$ is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applicative_functor">applicative functor</a>!

	 <p/> We can start to see the intended interpretation of $\next \tau$ if we define a type
	 of streams:
		\[\mathbf{data}\ \mathrm{Stream}_\tau = \tau \x \next \mathrm{Stream}_\tau \]
	 and then $\mathrm{Stream}_\tau$ is a
	 a stream of $\tau$s which arrives one per time step. For by definition,
	 a $\mathrm{Stream}_\tau$ is a $\tau$ right now, and also a stream one time step later.
	 <p/>
	 Furthermore the type $\next \mathrm{Stream}_\tau$ is a stream of
	 $\tau$s that arrives at same rate at which plain old
	 $\mathrm{Stream}_\tau$ would arrive &mdash; but it <I>starts one
	 time step later</I>. Thus on the first time step, $e$ has to cough
	 up a $\tau$ somehow even though its `input stream' hasn't produced
	 anything yet. On the second time step, the old value from the
	 fixpoint shows up, and $e$ can use it, but no more data is
	 available, etc. etc. So this type system forces the stream
	 computation to be productive.
	 <p/>
	 With these tools we can generate streams by taking a fixpoint at
	 $\N \to \mathrm{Stream}_\N$:
	 \[
	 x : \next(\N \to \mathrm{Stream}_\N) \prov \lambda k . \langle k, x * \mathrm{next}(k+1) \rangle : \N \to \mathrm{Stream}_\N
	 \over
	  \prov \mathbf{fix}\ x. \lambda k . \langle k, x * \mathrm{next}(k+1) \rangle : \N \to \mathrm{Stream}_\N
	 \]
	 This function takes $k$ and produces the stream $k, k+1, k+2, k+3, \cdots$.
	 <p/>
	 We can also write stream combinators:
	 \[
	 x : \next(\mathrm{Stream}_\N \to \mathrm{Stream}_\N) \prov
	 \lambda \langle hd, tl \rangle . \langle hd + 1, x * tl \rangle :
	 \mathrm{Stream}_\N \to \mathrm{Stream}_\N
	 \over
	  \prov \mathbf{fix}\ x.\lambda \langle hd, tl \rangle . \langle hd + 1, x * tl \rangle  :
	 \mathrm{Stream}_\N\to \mathrm{Stream}_\N
	 \]
	 This function takes a stream of numbers and adds one to every element of it.
	 <p/>

	 However, Guatto observes that this particular modality has limited expressive power
	 for capturing various <I>reasons</I> a computation might be productive. It works
	 fine as long as you only need to consume one element of your input stream for each
	 element you output, but doesn't have much to say about other sorts of stuttering
	 and time-varying (but nonetheless bounded) patterns of stream consumption.
	 <p/>
	 Guatto's solution is to introduce a whole family $\next_f$ of applicative functors,
	 one for each 'time warp' function $f$, which is required to be a monotone continuous
	 function from the ordinal $\omega + 1$ to itself. The $\next$ that we know is just
	 one particular special function in this family, the time warp, the function that
	 takes every finite element $x \in \omega$ to $x + 1$. By using other functions,
	 Guatto can account for computations that can produce data at time $f(t)$ depending
	 on data existing at time $t$.

	 <h2>Warping Relations</h2>
	 The other example I understand even
	 less, but on a formal level it's clear that the same thing is
	 going on.
	 <p/>

	 Andreas Nuyts and Dominique Devriese had a paper about
	 "<a href="https://people.cs.kuleuven.be/~andreas.nuyts/paper-reldtt.pdf">Degrees of Relatedness</a>"
	 (<a href="https://people.cs.kuleuven.be/~andreas.nuyts/reldtt-lics.pdf">slides</a>)
	 that aims to organize and generalize a whole bunch of modalities
	 having not to do with time, but with parametricity and
	 irrelevance.

	 <p/> Every type is equipped with an infinite family of binary
	 relations, and all functions are required to preserve them.
	 Modalities are allowed to take in a type, monotonically reindex
	 the family of relations belonging to it, and spit out the result
	 as another type; somehow when you consider functions from the
	 universe, and choose the right modality, this results in "takes a
	 type parametrically", "takes a type only with ad-hoc
	 polymorphism", "takes in some data proof-irrelevantly", and other
	 previously unrelated concepts!

	 <p/>I wonder if there is a meaningful/useful sense in which we can think of
	 the series of relations as occurring "in time", so that these two warping notions
	 sort of coincide?
