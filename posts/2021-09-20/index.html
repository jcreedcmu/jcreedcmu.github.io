    <h1>Map Colorings in Type Theory</h1>
    <h2>Type Operators</h2>
    Consider a type operator $Foo : \rset \x \rset \to \rset$. What are some things it can be?
    It could be, for example
    \[ Foo = \lambda (A, B) . A + A + A + B + B \]
    or
    \[ Foo = \lambda (A, B) . B \]
    or
    \[ Foo = \lambda (A, B) . 1 \]
    or
    \[ Foo = \lambda (A, B) . A \x B + A + 3 \]
    or lots of other things. I'm going to restrict my attention to examples more like the first two,
    and depict them in the following way:
    <center>
      <table style="text-align: center;">
        <tr><td><img src="figure1a.png"> </td><td><img src="figure1b.png"></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>$ Foo = \lambda (A, B) . A + A + A + B + B $</td>
          <td>$ Foo = \lambda (A, B) . B $</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </center>
    The intuition behind these pictures is this: $A$ and $B$ are knobs that we can turn.
    We can set them to a type that has any number of elements we like. We can replace every occurrence
    of the $A$ and $B$ in the diagram with a copy of the input type, and we'll get a picture of the type
    the type operator outputs. For example, if we set $A$ to 2 and $B$ to 3, we get
    <center>
      <table style="text-align: center;">
        <tr><td><img src="figure2a.png"> </td><td><img src="figure2b.png"></td>
        <tr>
          <td>$2 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 3 $</td>
          <td>$ 3 $</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </center>
    <h2>Higher Type Operators</h2>
    We can get even fancier if we allow type operators to build their output using <i>higher inductive types</i> from
    homotopy type theory.
    For example, we might write the type $ Foo = \lambda(A, B) . A + A + A + B + B$ in pseudo-Agda as
    <pre>
    data Foo (A B : Set) : Set where
        injA1 injA2 injA3 : A → Foo A B
        injB1 injB2 : B → Foo A B
    </pre>
    but beyond that we could imagine adding <i>equations</i> between elements, perhaps a different type
    <pre>
    data Bar (A B : Set) : Set where
        injA1 injA2 injA3 : A → Bar A B
        injB1 injB2 : B → Bar A B
        path1 : (a : A) → injA1 a ≡ injA2 a
        path2 : (a : A) (b : B) → injA3 a ≡ injB2 b
    </pre>
    and we might visualize this as
    <center><img src="figure3.png"></center>
    If we can introduce equations, we can make the blobs in the picture "adjacent" to one another.
    <h2>More Inputs</h2>
    Let's look at a couple examples of some type-operators that take <b>three</b> inputs.
    <center>
      <table>
        <tr style="vertical-align: top;">
          <td>
            <pre>
data Line (A B C : Set) : Set where
    injA : A → Line A B C
    injB : B → Line A B C
    injC : C → Line A B C

    pathAB : (a : A) (b : B) → injA a ≡ injB b
    pathBC : (b : B) (c : C) → injB b ≡ injC c
            </pre>
          </td>
          <td>
            <pre>
data Tri (A B C : Set) : Set where
    injA : A → Tri A B C
    injB : B → Tri A B C
    injC : C → Tri A B C

    pathAB : (a : A) (b : B) → injA a ≡ injB b
    pathBC : (b : B) (c : C) → injB b ≡ injC c
    pathAC : (a : A) (c : C) → injA a ≡ injC c

    higher-path : (a : A) (b : B) (c : C) →
        pathAB a b • pathBC b c ≡ pathAC a c
            </pre>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr  style="text-align: center;"><td><img src="figure4a.png"> </td><td><img src="figure4b.png"></td>
      </table>
    </center>
	 We have constructed the type <tt>Line</tt> as three blobs connected to one another in a line. The
	 set $A$ might have any number of elements, and the set $B$ might have any number of elements,
	 but any pair of them has a path equating the $a$ and the $b$. Likewise any $b$ and any $c$.
	 It might seem like any $a$ and any $c$ have to be equal, by the fact that we can compose
	 any two paths in HoTT, but this conclusion is premature --- we don't actually know that our input $B$ will
	 have any inhabitants! So the topology of the type operator <tt>Line</tt> is revealed by the fact that although
	 \[\mathrm {Line}\ 1\ 1\ 1 \equiv 1\]
	 &mdash; that is, the line is just one contractible blob isomorphic to the
	 unit type if all of the arguments $A, B, C$ are the unit type &mdash; we have nonetheless that
	 \[\mathrm {Line}\ 1\ 0\ 1 \equiv 2\]
	 If we set $B$ to the empty type, then the result is the type with two elements.

	<p/>
	On the other hand, we have
	 \[\mathrm {Tri}\ 1\ 1\ 1 \equiv 1\]
	and also
	 \[\mathrm {Tri}\ 1\ 0\ 1 \equiv 1\]
	! So at least we know that $\mathrm{Tri}$ and $\mathrm{Line}$ are
	different, even if you don't believe my diagrams.

	<h2>More General Maps</h2>

	We can now see how, in a univalent universe, a type operator $F :
	\rset^n \to \rset$ could contain the data of not just "how many
	times" its arguments are summed, but also a lot of topological
	information about how they're glued to one another &mdash; it's something like,
	a map (in the sense of "all planar maps are 4-colorable") with $n$ countries in it. Quite possibly
	some kind of further regularity/parametricity constraints need to be imposed to actually require planarity or
	to exclude pathological cases, but let's say provisionally that for any index set $I$ that
	 <blockquote style="background-color: #def; padding: 10px;">
		A <I>map with countries indexed by $I$</I>
		is a functor
		\[ \mu : (I \to \rset) \to \rset \]
		such that $\mu(\lambda j . i \equiv j)$ is a contractible type for every $i : I$.
	 </blockquote>
	The idea is that the $I$-indexed set of type $(I \to \rset)$
	generalizes our ability to "turn on" and "turn off" the presence of
	any particular country, and "read off" how many connected
	components there are (actually: read off the homotopy equivalence class of just
	those countries) in the resulting sub-map.
	 <p/>
	 For example, our map might be a functor
	 \[\mu : (\{A,B,\ldots, M,N,O\} \to \rset) \to \rset \]
	 depicted by
	 <center><img src="figure5a.png"></center>
	 and if we plugged in a specific family of sets
	 \[\mathbf F : (\{A,B,\ldots, M,N,O\} \to \rset)\]
	 where
	 \[ \F(A) = \F(B) = \F(C) = \F(E) = \F(F) = \F(G) = \F(M) = \F(N) = 1\]
	 and $\F(x) = 0$ otherwise, we would find that $\mu(\F)$ would be the type $S^1 + 2$:
	 <center><img src="figure5b.png"></center>
	 The condition that $\mu(\lambda j . i \equiv j)$ is saying that if we "enable"/"turn on" a single country
	 by setting its type input to 1 and every other type's input to 0 (at least this is what is happening if the indexing
	 type $I$ is a mere set!) then the "area that the country takes up on the map" is actually a contractible region.

	 <h2>Map Colorings</h2>
	 The set $I$ is essentially the set of "names" of the countries in a map. A coloring of a map is a function
	 $k : I \to C$ from country names to a set $C$ of colors, such that no two adjacent countries have the same color.
	 It came as a surprise to me that there's a very slick HoTT-flavored way of expressing this constraint.
	 <p/>
	 Suppose we have an $I$-map $\mu : (I \to \rset) \to \rset$ and a color assignment $k : I \to C$. Notice that there
	 is a fairly evident way of building a value of type
	 \[ I \to \sum_{c: C} \mu(\lambda j . c \equiv k(j))\]
	 What will this map do? It takes a country name as an input. It's going to generate a value in the $k(i)$ branch
	 of the $\sum$ over $c : C$. So it's going to generate a dependent pair &mdash; whose first component we just said
	 was $k(i)$, and whose second component must be of type
	 \[ \mu(\lambda j . k(i) \equiv k(j)) \]
	 But here's a fact: we know that $\mu(\lambda j . i \equiv j)$ is inhabited, because in fact $\mu$ being a map
	 means it's contractible. And $\mu$ is a functor, and we can certainly get from $i \equiv j$ to $k i\equiv k j$,
	 (because we can apply functions to paths), so we can get from $\mu(\lambda j . i \equiv j)$ to $\mu(\lambda j . ki \equiv kj)$.
	 This finishes the argument that there is a reasonable function of type
	 \[ I \to \sum_{c: C} \mu(\lambda j . c \equiv k(j))\]
	 What is this function expressing? It's the map <i>from</i> the set of country names
	 into a type that is constructed by considering each color in turn, and adding in a type that consists
	 of what you get when you "enable"/"turn on" all the countries that have that color.
	 But any countries in this process that are adjacent to one another <i>and</i> which have the same color
	 in the coloring will be "glued together"! So we make the definition:
	 <p/>
	 <blockquote style="background-color: #def; padding: 10px;">
		A <i>coloring of an $I$-country map $\mu$ with colors from $C$</i> is
		a map $k : I \to C$ such that the evident induced function \[ I
		\to \sum_{c: C} \mu(\lambda j . c \equiv k(j))\] is an
		equivalence.
	 </blockquote>
	 We can see in the <b>non</b>-example of a coloring
	 <center><img src="figure6.png"></center>
	 that it fails to be a coloring because $A, B \in I$ map to the same point in
	 \[\sum_{c: C} \mu(\lambda j . c \equiv k(j))\]

	 <h2>Planarity</h2>

	 I'd love to be able to make a clever "synthetic" restatement of
	 the four-color theorem at this point, but I'm not quite sure how
	 to enforce that maps are planar! However tempting it is to lean on
	 the HoTT interpretation of the 2-sphere, I'm pretty sure it's <b>not</b>
	 good enough to say
	 <blockquote style="background-color: #fdd; padding: 10px;">
		A map $\mu$ is <i>planar</i> iff
		$\mu(\lambda \underline{\ }.1)$
		is equivalent to the type $S^2$.
	 </blockquote>
	 What's happening here is I'm trying to express the idea of erasing country labels, and recovering the underlying
	 space the map is taking place on by setting all the countries' "multiplicity" to 1 &mdash; that is, by passing
	 the function $\lambda \underline{\ }.1$ to the map $\mu$. Now for sure a planar map <i>should</I> have this property,
	 but I think it's insufficient &mdash; I think you could layer countries "on top of" other countries, leading
	 to more adjacencies than a planar map should allow, while still retaining the property that the "erased" map
	 still has the homotopy type of $S^2$.
	 <p/>
	 However! I think doing this would require a higher inductive type with clauses that postulate the existence of
	 paths-of-paths-of-paths to adequately "glue together" these extra illegal countries made up only of airspace.
	 And this seems like an intrinsically "3-dimensional" thing to do. So maybe we can forbid it?

	 <blockquote style="background-color: #ddd; padding: 10px;">
		<b>Conjecture Template:</b> Suppose $\mu$ is a sufficiently well-behaved functor of type $(I \to \rset) \to \rset$,
		and $I$ is a finite mere set. "Well-behaved" includes at least that
		<ul>
		  <li>$\mu$ is a map
		  <li> $\mu$ is built up inductively only from injections, paths
			 between injections, and
			 paths-between-paths-between-injections, in some suitable
			 sense.
		  <li> $\mu(\lambda \underline{\ }.1) \cong S^2$
		</ul>
		Then there exists a coloring $I \to 4$ of $\mu$.
