    <h1>Do Univalent Universes Arise from Higher Adjoints?</h1>

<h2>A 2-Category of Trees</h2>
    <p>
      If we let a 2-category be freely generated by postulating that we have
      <ul>
        <li> an object $C$
        <li> a morphism $f : C \to C$
        <li> a 2-cell $\eta : \rid_C \to f$
        <li> a 2-cell $\mu : f \o f \to f$
      </ul>
      then the string diagrams we can draw for 2-cells
      in $\C$ look like forests:

      <center><img src="diagram1.png"></center>

      We might squint and think that this is <i>kind of like</i> the
      set of (order-preserving) functions from one finite ordered set
      to another. For example, the above image is sort of like the
      function $h$ that takes $\{0,1,2,3,4,5\}$ to $\{a,b,c\}$ by
      assigning $h(0)=0,h(1)=a,h(2)=a,h(3)=a, h(4)=b$. But it's not
      exactly that: the string diagram keeps track of more information
      than the mere function $h$ does. The string diagram keeps track
      of the fact that we first collapsed 0 and 1, then merged with 2,
      then merged with 3. The function $h$ knows merely that 0,1,2,3
      all collapse together without remembering how they got there.
      <h2>A 2-Category of Ordered Functions</h2>
      If we instead let a 2-category be freely generated by postulating that we have
      <ul>
        <li> objects $C, D$
        <li> morphisms $u : D \to C$ and $f : C \to D$
        <li> a 2-cell $\eta : \rid_C \to uf$
        <li> a 2-cell $\epsilon : fu \to \rid_D$
        <li> the triangle equalities for $\eta$ and $\epsilon$ being the unit and counit of an adjunction
      </ul>

      <center><img src="diagram2.png"></center>

      Then naturality naturally equates diagrams that represent equal functions.
      However, this only captures <i>order-preserving</i> functions between finite ordered sets.
      <h2>A 3-Category of Braided Functions</h2>
      We could go up one more dimension, working in a 3-category, postulating
      <ul>
        <li> objects $C, D$
        <li> morphisms $u : D \to C$ and $f : C \to D$
        <li> a 2-cell $\eta : \rid_C \to uf$
        <li> a 2-cell $\eta^* : uf \to \rid_C$
          <li> some 3-cells of type $\rid_{\rid_C} \to \eta^*\eta$
            and $\eta\eta^* \to \rid_{\rid_C} $
      </ul>

      <center><img src="diagram3.png"></center>
      In this case the 2-cells $\rid_{\rid_C} \to \rid_{\rid_C}$ resemble finite sets,
      and the 3-cells between them resemble arbitrary maps between them --- except
      they keep track of extra "braiding" information. For example, the following
      3-cell would be distinguished from the "identity function on the 2-element set":
      <center><img src="diagram4.png"></center>

      <h2>An $n$-Category of Functions between Higher Sets</h2>

      Presumably if we go up to sufficiently high dimensions, these
      "low-dimensional" phenomena stabilize and disappear, and we're
      left with a $n$-dimensional category whose $(n-1)$-cells are
      finite sets and whose $n$-cells are functions between them. Or
      perhaps this doesn't actually stabilize at some finite stage and
      $\mathbf{FinSet}$ is attained as some kind of limit.

    <p>
      However, there are more cells we could have added which could
      give us more interesting structure. Even at the 3-category
      level, let's imagine throwing in all of:
      <ul>
        <li> objects $C, D$
        <li> morphisms $u : D \to C$ and $f : C \to D$
        <li> a 2-cell $\eta : \rid_C \to uf$
        <li> a 2-cell $\eta^* : uf \to \rid_C$
        <li> a 2-cell $\epsilon^* : \rid_D \to fu$
        <li> a 2-cell $\epsilon : fu \to \rid_D$
        <li> various unspecified 3-cells
      </ul>

      With these tools we could imagine describing sets with elements
      with holes in them, just like higher types in homotopy type
      theory:
      <center><img src="diagram5.png"></center>

      And at sufficiently high dimensions it seems conceivable that a
      wide range of HITs would be attainable, and all functions
      between them.

      <p>
        <b>Question 1:</b> Exactly what <I>should</I> the postulated set
        of cells be at each dimension, to recover the category of
        finite higher sets and maps between them?
      <p>
        It seems like some kind of very strong high-dimensional
        adjoint equivalence at all dimensions but the highest, but I
        don't know enough about higher categories to make a concrete
        conjecture. And, I guess, follow-up question:
      <p>
        <b>Question 2:</b> Does this algebraically created "universe of
        finite higher sets" satisfy univalence?
