    <h1>Chromatic Type Polynomials</h1>
    <h2>Inclusion-Exclusion</h2>
	 In the following diagram, how do we count the dots that are <b>either</b> inside circle $A$ or circle $B$?
	 <center>	 <img src="inclusion-exclusion-1.png"></center>
	 It's the sum of the dots in circle $A$, plus the dots in circle $B$, minus the dots that are in both, because
	 by adding up the circles, we've double-counted their intersection. We could write this as
	 \[|A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B|\]
	 <p/>
	 What do we do if we want to count how many dots are in more overlapping circles? Well, by using the above,
	 we can reason that
	 \[ | A \cup (B \cup C)| = | A | + |B \cup C| - |A \cap (B \cup C)| \]
	 \[= | A | + |B | + | C| - |B \cap C| - |A \cap (B \cup C)|\]
	 But $\cap$ distributes over $\cup$: $A \cap (B \cup C) = (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C)$. So in fact
	 \[ | A \cup (B \cup C)| =  | A | + |B | + | C| - |B \cap C| - |(A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C)|\]
	 \[=  | A | + |B | + | C| - |B \cap C| - |A \cap B | - | A \cap C|  + |A \cap B \cap A \cap C|\]
	 \[=  | A | + |B | + | C| - |B \cap C| - |A \cap B | - | A \cap C|  + |A \cap B \cap C|\]

	 We have to subtract the overcounts in the overlaps between each
	 two regions, and add <b>back</b> the resulting undercount in the
	 triple overlap.

	 <p/>
	 For example, the number of dots in the following diagram is 11:
	 <center><img src="inclusion-exclusion-2.png"></center>
	 In general, we find that if we want to count the size of the union of $n$ sets, $A_1, \ldots, A_n$, we need
	 to take contributions from, for every finite subset $S$ of $1,\ldots, n$, the intersection of all the $A_s$ where
	 $s$ is drawn from $S$, either adding it or subtracting it depending on whether $|S|$ is even or odd.

	 \[ \left| \bigcup_{i} A_i \right| = \sum_{\emptyset \ne S \subseteq 1,\ldots, n } (-1)^{|S|+1} \left|\bigcap_{s\in S} A_s\right|\]
	 This is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inclusion%E2%80%93exclusion_principle">inclusion-exclusion principle</a>.
	 <h2>Graph Colorings</h2>
	 How many ways are there of assigning elements of some set $X = \{x, y, z, \ldots\}$ to the vertices of the graph
	 <center><img src="graph.png"></center>
	 such that at least one edge gets the same element for both its endpoints? This "at least one" is a big disjunction,
	 so we can use inclusion exclusion. Let's say $|X| = K$. Then 	we find there are $3K^3 - 3K^2 + K$ ways of doing it.
	 <center><img src="graph-coloring.png"></center>

	 Symbolically, we're computing
	 \[  \sum_{\emptyset \ne S \subseteq E } (-1)^{|S|+1} K^{k(S)} \]
	 where $E$ is the set of edges in the graph, and $k(S)$ is the number of connected components of the graph if
	 we include only the edges $S$.
	 <p/>

	 Now let's consider the "opposite" question: How many ways are
	 there of assigning elements of $X$ to vertices such that <b>no</b>
	 edges have the same assignment for both endpoints? (This is
	 a "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_coloring">graph
	 coloring</a>") All we have to do is subtract the answer to the
	 previous question from the total number of colorings, which is
	 $K^4$ in this case because there are four vertices. This actually simplifies our sum because we don't have to exclude
	 the case where $S$ is empty. We write $\chi(K)$ for the number of colorings of the graph with $K$ colors,
	 and find that
	 \[  \chi(K) = \sum_{ S \subseteq E } (-1)^{|S|} K^{k(S)} \]
	 This is a polynomial in the variable $K$, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_polynomial">chromatic polynomial</a> of a graph.

	 <h2>Random Graph Statistics</h2>

	 Suppose we have a graph, and for every edge flip a coin with heads
	 probability $p$, and if it comes up tails, delete the edge. What's
	 the expected number of ways to color the graph with $K$ colors such that every
	 edge has the same colors at both endpoints?

	 \[   \sum_{ S \subseteq E } p^{|S|} (1-p)^{|E|-|S|}K^{k(S)} \]
	 This appears basically the same as our previous polynomial, except for the normalization factor $(1-p)^{|E|}$
	 and the minor inconvenience that no particular value of $p$ will actually make $p / (1-p)$ equal $-1$.
	 <p/>
	 So here's a polynomial that generalizes both cases, by setting $y$ to either $-1$ or $p / (1-p)$, however we want:

	 \[  T(x, y) =  \sum_{ S \subseteq E } y^{|S|} x^{k(S)} \]

	 To recap what we've done, this is essentially the chromatic
	 polynomial with the $-1$ generalized to $y$, and the $K$ renamed
	 to $x$. It turns out this is equivalent to
	 the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tutte_polynomial">Tutte
	 polynomial</a> up to a change of variables. It is called the
	 "Random Cluster Model" on that wikipedia page, except they use
	 variable names $q, w$ instead of $x, y$, respectively.

	 <h2>The Chromatic Type Polynomial</h2> Everything we've done up
	 until now is about numbers and counting. But it's actually quite
	 easy to reinterpret the same expression above as being a
	 computation of a <b>type</b> (in the sense of Martin-L&ouml;f type
	 theory, &amp; even <a href="https://homotopytypetheory.org/book/">Homotopy type theory</a>) in terms of other types.

	 <p/>
	 To start, replace numeric variables $x$ and $y$ with type variables $x$ and $y$.
	 <p/>
	 Then we replace the numeric sum $\sum_{S \subseteq E}$ with
	  a <b>dependent sum type</b> $(H : \mathrm{Subgraph}\ G) \x \dash$ over all (edge-wise) subgraphs of $G$.

	 The <b>number</b> that you get by raising $y$ to the power of $|S|$ can be replaced with the actual <b>type</b> $E_H \to y$
	 of functions
	 from the edges $E_H$ of the subgraph $H$, to the type $y$. Similarly, the expression $x^{k(S)}$, which counts the connected
	 components of the subgraph $S$, and raises $x$ to that power, can be replaced with $\real S \to x$,
	 functions from the <b>realization</b> $\real H$ (more about that in a second) of the
	 graph $H$ as a type, to the type $x$.
	 <p/>
	 So we write
	 \[T(x, y) = (H : \mathrm{Subgraph}\ G) \x (E_H \to y) \x (\real H \to x) \]
	 <h2>Realization of a Graph</h2>
	 We still need to define what the realization of a graph is.
	 It is defined as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_type#Higher_inductive_types">Higher Inductive Type</a>:
	 we say $\real G$ is defined as the type such that
	 <ul>
		<li>For every vertex $v$ in the vertices of $G$, there is an element of $\real G$, call it $\iota v$.
		<li>For every edge $e$ in $G$ that has endpoints $v_1, v_2$, there is an equality $\iota v_1 \equiv \iota v_2$ in $\real G$.
	 </ul>
	 By defining it this way, we're essentially saying that the realization of a graph is the type where all the
	 edges <b>become equalities</b> between the vertices they connect.
	 <p/>
	 Here's some examples:
	 <center><img src="realization.png"></center>
	 It is worth noting that every <b>cycle</b> in a
	 graph becomes a <b>loop</b> (i.e. non-trivial self-equality) in the realization of that graph.
	 The realization of every connected graph without cycles is just the unit type $1$.
	 The realization of every graph that has exactly one cycle is the same; they're all the circle
	 type $S^1$, and so on. If the type of vertices and edges of $G$ are mere sets,
	 then the realization of $G$ basically just counts cycles.
	 <h2> The Chromatic Type distinguishes more graphs than the Tutte Polynomial</h2>
	 Consider the following two graphs: <center><img src="graphs.png"></center>

	 We can manually compute the chromatic type of $G_1$, and write it
	 'as if' it were a polynomial by considering all edge-wise
	 subgraphs, and adding a term for each one with $x$ raised to the
	 power of the realization of the subgraph, and $y$ raised to the
	 power of how many edges the subgraph it has. This will look like a
	 polynomial, except some of the exponents will involve circle
	 types, or other types with more loops, according to the homotopy
	 structure of the subgraphs.
	 <center><img src="g1-comp.png"></center>
	 We can do thes same for $G_2$:
	 <center><img src="g2-comp.png"></center>
	 Notice that it's very similar to the polynomial for $G_1$, but the last term is different.
	 <p/>
	 Now the Tutte polynomials (well, technically, the Random Cluster Model polynomials) for these
	 graphs are both
	 \[ x^2 + xy + 2x^2y + 2xy^2 + xy^3 + x^2y^3 \]

	 What's going on is that the Tutte polynomial bakes in
	 a <b>set-truncation</b> operation --- it can only count
	 how <b>many</b> connected components there are. It's as if it's
	 collapsing all of the loop type, the double-loop type, and so on, to
	 the unit type $1$. In this way it conflates the $x^○x^○= x^{2○}$ from the polynomial of $G^1$,
	 and the $x^{○\!○}x^1$ that appears in the polynomial for $G_2$, and sees both of them as merely $x^2$.

	 <p/>

	 On the other hand, the chromatic <b>type</b>, by computing the
	 realization of a graph, can tell these apart: it sees not only the quantity of
	 connected components, but also which components have holes in
	 them, and how many.

	 <p/>
	 (I have a suspicion that the known Khovanov-homology-esque
	 categorifications of graph polynomials may also do this refined
	 counting, but I don't know enough about them to say so for sure.)

	 <h2>Contraction-Deletion</h2>
	 There's a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deletion%E2%80%93contraction_formula">standard result</a>
	 you can prove about chromatic (and Tutte) polynomials, that connects the "all-at-once" characterization
	 as a sum over all possible subgraphs on the one hand, with a nice inductive characterization in terms of a single edge.
	 You would say something like:
	 <ul>
		<li> For a graph $G$ with no edges, its polynomial is just $x$ raised to the power of how many vertices it has,
		  i.e. $T_G(x, y) = x^{V_G}$.
		<li> For any other graph $G$, and any edge $e$ in $G$, the polynomial of $G$ can be specified in terms
		  of the graph $G - e$ arising from deleting the edge $e$, and the graph $G / e$ arising from <b>contracting</b> the edge
		  $e$, and joining together the vertices that were its endpoint.
		  \[ T_G(x, y) = T_{G - e}(x, y) + yT_{G / e}(x, y) \]
	 </ul>
	 To the extent that these graph polynomials are about the expected value of some statistic for independent random behavior
	 of the edges of a graph, the inductive step of this description is essentially about marginalizing against the behavior
	 of a single edge.

	 <p/> How do we generalize this to the chromatic type case? It's
	 easier to talk about <b>adding</b> an edge rather than deleting
	 it. So if $\partial = (\partial_1, \partial_2)$ is a pair of
	 vertices in $G$, let $G + \partial$ be the graph with one
	 additional edge between the vertices in $\partial$, and let $G / \partial$ be the result of actually adding an equality path
	 between the vertices in $G$. That is, the type of vertices of $G / \partial$ is a higher inductive type derived from the
	 vertex type of $G$.
	 <p/>
	 Given these definitions, we can claim
	 <ul>
		<li> For a graph $G$ with no edges, its polynomial is functions from its vertex type to the variable $x$,
		  \[ T_G(x, y) \equiv {V_G} \to x\]
 		<li> For any graph $G$, and any edge boundary $\partial : V_G \x V_G$, we have
		  \[ T_{G + \partial}(x, y) \equiv T_G(x, y) + y \x T_{G / \partial}(x, y) \]
	 </ul>

	 Here $+$ refers to the sum type and $\x$ to the product type constructor, and all equalities are equalities of types,
	 which under assumption of the univalence axiom, means there is a bijection between types.
	 <h2>Non-boolean Edge Behavior</h2>
	 The preceding assumes that edges <b>either</b> contract or delete. We can also make a modest generalization, and
	 say that there is some index type $J$ of "actions edges can take", and a type $Q$ equipped with a map $\pi : Q \to J$
	 such that if the fiber over a given $j : J$ is empty, then "what the edge does" is delete, and if the fiber has
	 one element, "what the edge does" is contract, and if the fiber has more elements, then the edge may turn into a collection
	 of equality paths with greater multiplicity.
	 <p/>
	 Instead of taking the dependent sum over all subgraphs (which are really functions $E \to 2$) we take the sum over
	 all maps $E \to J$ instead. The definition of the chromatic type is now
	 \[T(x, y) = (S : E \to J) \x ((S \star \pi) \to y) \x (\real {G|_S} \to x) \]
	 where $S \star \pi$ is the pullback of $S : E \to J$ and $\pi : Q \to J$, and
	 $G|_S$ is the 'restriction' of $G$ to $S$, where we have replaced every edge $e$ in $G$ with one edge for
	 every point in the fiber $\mathsf{fib}_\pi (S(e))$. Our previous definition of $T$ is recovered when $Q = 1$ and $J = 2$.
	 <p/>

	 The contraction-deletion theorem now turns the discrete sum over
	 the two possibilities (that an edge is deleted or contracted) into
	 a dependent sum over the type $J$:

	 \[ T_{G + \partial}(x, y) = (j : J) \x (\fib j \to y) \x T_{G / \partial^{\fib j}}(x, y) \]

	 Here $G / \partial^X$ for a type $X$ means $G$ with the vertex type replaced by a higher inductive type
	 that has been equipped with extra equality paths between the vertices in $\partial$, one for
	 every element of $X$.

	 <h2>Formalization</h2> I formalized the proof of this
	 contraction-deletion theorem in cubical agda. I found it quite
	 pleasant, especially compared to earlier failed attempts (due not
	 to any fundamental limitation of plain agda, but just from my lack
	 of patience) without the cubical extension. The code is
	 in <a href="http://github.com/jcreedcmu/chromatic-type-polynomial">http://github.com/jcreedcmu/chromatic-type-polynomial</a>.
