	 <h1>Slices of Presheaf Categories</h1>
	 <p>
		I wanted to give a little attention to a well-known, but I think
		under-hyped, lemma from elementary category theory. Honestly I
		think it's about as lovely and simple as the Yoneda lemma or the
		fact that the Grothendieck construction works, and it has a
		somewhat related flavor to both of them. You can find it
		mentioned <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/category+of+presheaves">here
		on nLab</a>, which has a pointer to some nice sheaf-theoretic
		generalizations in MacLane and Moerdijk.
	 </p>
	 <p>the statement of it is: Suppose $\C$ is a category, and $P$ is a presheaf in $\hat \C = \rset^{\C^\op}$. Then
		\[ \hat \C / P \cong \widehat{\int P} \]
		That is, the slice
		category $\hat \C / P$ whose objects are natural transformations $Q \to P$ of any other presheaf $Q$ into $P$,
		and whose morphisms are commutative triangles,
		is isomorphic to $\widehat {\int P}$, the presheaf category on the category of elements of $P$, whose objects
		are pairs $(C, x)$ consisting of an object $C\in \C$ and an element $x \in P(C)$ of the presheaf, and whose morphisms
		$(C, x) \to (D, y)$ are morphisms $f : C \to D \in \C$ such that $P(f)(y) = x$.
	 </p>
		<h2>Proof</h2>
		Stare at the following diagram:
		<center>
		  <div class="twoimg">
			 <img src="diagram1.png">
			 <img class="overlay" src="diagram2.png">
		  </div>
		  <span class="mouseovermessage">(Mouseover to show other side of isomorphism)</span>
		</center>
		If we have a presheaf $Q \in \hat \C$ and a projection $\pi : Q \to P$,
		then the way we build a presheaf in $\widehat{\int P}$ is by taking the inverse
		image under $\pi^{-1}$:
		\[Q'(C, x) =  (\pi(C))^{-1}(x)\]
		Conversely, if we have a presheaf $Q' \in \widehat{\int P}$, we can define
		\[Q(C) = \bigcup_{x \in P(C)} Q'(C, x)\]
		and the choice of what to do at morphisms in both directions is pretty much forced.
		<h2>What It's Good For</h2>
	 <p>
		For one thing, this is sort of the crux of the reason you can do
		dependent type theory in presheaf categories. Since slices of
		presheaf categories are themselves presheaf categories, and
		since all presheaf categories are cartesian closed, that means
		all presheaf categories are <I>locally</I> cartesian closed.
	 </p>
	 <p>
		Another nice use of it was as a very useful simplifying tool when I was
		trying to think recently about what sort of situations you might find
		yourself in where you have a type theory and a type $\ii$ such
		that something like '$\ii \to \rtype$' is equivalent to a span
		of types, $(A\ B\ C : \rtype) \x (C \to A) \x (C \to B)$.
	 </p>
	 <p>
		Restricting our attention to the situation where 'type' means 'presheaf in $\hat \C$ for
		some choice of category $\C$', this means that $\ii \in \hat\C$.
		And thinking Grothendieck-ily, you could
		instead of '$\ii \to \rtype$' just ask for a choice of type $P\in\hat\C$
		 and a map $P \to \ii$.
	 </p>
	 <p>
		But the above lemma is telling us this is the same thing as a presheaf in
		$\widehat{\int \ii}$! And "a span of types in $\rset^{\C^\op}$" is also really
		just a presheaf-y notion, since it's the same thing as
		$(\rset^{\C^\op})^S = \rset^{\C^\op \x S}$ for the span category $S$ that
		has three objects $\{A_1, A_2, \star\}$ and only two nontrivial morphisms $\star \to A_1$
		and $\star \to A_2$.
	 </p>
	 <p>
		Therefore all we really need to find is a $\ii$ such that the
		base categories of these two different categories are the same,
		i.e. $\left(\int \ii\right)^\op \cong \C^\op \x S$. This is way
		simpler than trying to analyze all possible presheaves $\ii$ and
		other presheaves $P$, and their mappings into $\ii$ directly.
	 </p>
	 <p>
		For example, I can say, let the category $\C$ be the category whose objects are
		<center>Contexts $\Gamma,\Delta,\Omega$ ::= $\cdot \celse \Gamma , x$</center>
		And whose morphisms $\Gamma \to \Delta$ are
		substitutions $\Gamma \prov \theta : \Delta$ whose syntax is
		<center>Substitutions $\theta$ ::= $\cdot \celse \theta[M/ x]$</center>
		<center>Terms $M$ ::= $x \celse \ep 1 \celse \ep 2$</center>
		which are typed like
		\[
		{\Gamma \prov \theta : \Delta \qquad \Omega \prov M
		\over
		\Gamma, \Omega \prov \theta[M/x] : \Delta, x}
		\qquad {\over \cdot \prov \ep 1}
		\qquad {\over \cdot \prov \ep 2}
		\qquad {\over x \prov x}
		\]

		In the typing of substitutions, we <b>don't</b> assume that contexts have
		contraction, weakening, or exchange.
	 </p>
	 <p>
		Now let $\ii$ be the presheaf in $\hat \C$ such that
		<center> <table>
			 <tr><td>$\ii(\cdot)$</td><td>$=$</td><td>$\{\ep 1, \ep 2\}$</td></tr>
			 <tr><td>$\ii(\Gamma, x)$</td><td>$=$</td><td>$\{\ep 1, \ep 2, x\}$</td></tr>
		</table></center>
		with the action of morphisms being the only reasonable thing it can be; syntactically
		carrying out the substitution.
	 </p>
	 <p>I now claim that $(\int \ii)^\op$ is the same thing as $\C^\op \x S$. Let's
		describe a map $\rho$ from $\C^\op \x S$ to $(\int \ii)^\op$. The input
		we're given is an object $\Gamma \in \C$ and an object of $S$. The object of $S$
		can either be $\star, A_1$, or $A_2$. We need to output a pair consisting of
		an object in $\C$ and an element of $\ii(\Gamma)$. So we define
		\[\rho(\Gamma, \star) = ((\Gamma, x), x) \]
		\[\rho(\Gamma, A_1) = (\Gamma, \ep 1) \]
		\[\rho(\Gamma, A_2) = (\Gamma, \ep 2) \]
		And if we examine the morphisms of $\int \ii$ &mdash; which are substitutions
		preserving the distinguished element &mdash; we find that they can be classified
		into "doing something to the context $\Gamma$" and "doing something to what's left", i.e.
		"a morphism in $\C^\op$" and "a morphism in $S$", respectively.

	 </p>
	 <p>
		And I think this example works even if you <I>do</I> add various
		structural rules to $\Gamma$. Which is interesting since as far
		as I can tell, Bernardy-Moulin internalized parametricity seems
		to require &mdash; or at least naturally works best with &mdash;
		exactly the structural rules it has, namely, weakening,
		exchange, and <I>not</I> contraction. Still pretty mysterious to
		me why! I suppose it must have something to do with what happens
		with the surrounding context, since everything I'm doing above
		is considering "closed" types that are full-stop presheaves not
		depending on any other variables.
