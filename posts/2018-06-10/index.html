	 This is a feeling I've been having a lot lately. The kernel of it
	 is something that is, I think, wholly <I>un</I>remarkable in
	 almost every creative field, but it's something that I've had to
	 learn and relearn in my guts several times. I'm going to try to
	 state the thing I'm talking about, and it's going to sound very
	 bland and obvious, but I'll say it anyway:
	 <blockquote>
		You probably have to make lots of wrong things before you're able to make the right thing.
	 </blockquote>
	 An artist makes sketches. A writer makes rough drafts. A musician rehearses. An
	 architect makes models
	 (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ffj8SHrbk0">which, as
	 such, are completely ineffective at achieving the goals of the actual building</a>)
	 Ok, sure, why is this interesting?

	 <h2>Is Mathematics Special</h2>
	 <p/> Because the notion of 'wrong' &mdash; or, maybe it's better to
	 say, our <I>expectations</I> of the notion of wrongness &mdash; in art,
	 and writing, and music, and architecture, and so on, are typically
	 somewhat different than what <I>wrongness</I> entails in math. The
	 'wrongness' that gets remediated through refinement, practice,
	 etc. is, more or less, a subjective wrongness, that is never
	 absolutely present or absolutely eliminated. The 'wrongness' of a
	 center-for-ants architectural model is a kind of
	 wrongness-of-symbolic-representation that isn't even really a
	 fault. A thing is made which <I>says things about</I> the real
	 object's structure, but it needn't be (and its usefulness is
	 predicated on not being) as fully developed as the real object.

	 <p/>But mathematics &mdash; good, old-fashioned formal mathematics
	 with Axioms and Definitions and Proofs &mdash; has a very clear notion of wrongness,
	 and on the face of it, it doesn't seem to have much <I>use</I> for wrong proofs.

	 <p/>And yet, here I am, with a pile of definitions and assertions
	 of consequences that I've been tinkering with for the last month
	 or so, and they're just <I>wrong</I>, and I know it. Some of the
	 asserted consequences do not follow from the definitions. Really
	 big, red-flag things, things that 100% need to be true for the
	 system to be taken at all seriously as a proof theory, things like
	 being able to implement <I>identity functions</I>, for crying out
	 loud, just flat out don't work yet. And yet I don't feel very
	 bothered about it!

	 <p/>I mean, don't get me wrong, I'm <I>somewhat</I> bothered. Some
	 of the section titles in my LaTeX notes are things like <b>Slight
	 Sense of Panic</b>. But it's not <I>surprising</I>; it's normal. This
	 is what research looks like.The conclusion that I'm drawn to is that math
	 actually <b>isn't</b> very special, and depends on drafts and
	 naive models and broken-assed garbage as much as any other field.

	 <p/>Certainly I should mention physics, in which QFT is the
	 shining example of how wrongness &mdash; by which I mean in this
	 case "lack of secure mathematical foundations" &mdash; has
	 provided apparently no impediment whatsoever to making just
	 stupidly accurate predictions about the physical world. On the
	 other hand, I still <I>am</I> a mathematician, and I find this
	 state of affairs unsatisfying as an <I>endpoint</I> &mdash; but it
	 does corroborate, I think, the notion that the human endeavor
	 of <I>doing</I> mathematics can survive and make progress even for
	 decades on the basis of merely some partially understood
	 principles with some partial formal probes into their
	 sensibleness.

	 <h2>How Can This Possibly Work</h2>
	 I think some things that make it possible to work on "wrong proofs" for so long
	 without becoming discouraged (at least for me) are
	 <ul>
		<li>
		  The mere fact that it's worked out before  &mdash; that I've spent
		  a long time massaging a gradually decreasingly incoherent pile
		  of intuitions and conjectures into a formally functioning piece
		  of mathematics.
		<li>
		  Being able to 'smell' signals of near-rightness among the
		  general cloud of wrongness. Things being more symmetric than
		  you'd expect. Theorems being aaaalmost satisfied. Things going
		  "the way they usually go" 90% of the way, leaving you with the
		  knowledge that <I>what you need to think about</I> is that
		  last 10%.
		<li>
		  Having notation that's compact enough that you can do small
		  calculations reliably enough to be confident in which parts of
		  the whole are wrong or right. I am absolutely <b>the worst</b>
		  at making frequent random algebra mistakes, and the rate at
		  which I make them seems to be simply proportional to how many
		  symbols I have to write down. Figuring how to present a
		  small-as-possible cross-section to the bit-flipping cosmic
		  rays of human stupidity is essential.
		<li>
		  Being able to use software in various ways that are in
		  principle unnecessary but in practice incredibly helpful for
		  guiding one's intuition through the swamp: certainly proof assistants, and
		  even the humble ability to copy-and-paste-and-modify text in an emacs buffer.
