    <h1>Set-Theoretic Geometry</h1>

    The purpose of this expository note is to distill something of
    what happens in algebraic geometry down to a really elementary
    level, where it's just about sets and functions, but which still
    retains some of the "geometric" or "spatial" feeling.
    <p>
      The usual slogan is that
      <blockquote>
        space is algebra backwards
      </blockquote>
      but you don't even have to have algebraic operations (like the
      multiplication or addition of a ring) to obtain a simple
      form of "space".
      <h2>Triangles of Functions</h2>
      Let's start by asking some questions that have simple answers.
      Let's say $k$ is the five-element set $\{a,b,c,d,e\}$, and let's write
      $k[X]$ for the six-element set $\{a,b,c,d,e,X\}$. Is there anything fundamentally
      different about the element $X$? Not really. But it's going to be treated differently
      in the examples to follow, so I want to emphasize its difference from the outset.
    <p>
      <b>Question</b>: Consider the inclusion $i_1 : k \to k[X]$, and the identity
      function $\rid : k \to k$. What functions $f : k[X] \to k$ have the property
      that $f \o i_1 = \rid$?
      <img src="picture1.png">
      <b>Answer</b>: The value of $f$ on any element of $k$ is fixed by the constraint
      that $f i_1 = \rid$. We must have $f(a) = a$, $f(b) = b$, etc. But $f's$ value on $X$
      is completely free. Therefore there are five possible $f$. One where $f(X) = a$,
      one where $f(X) = b$, etc.
    <p>
      Now let's say $k[X,Y]$ is the set $\{a,b,c,d,e,X,Y\}$, and ask
      <br>
      <b>Question</b>: Consider the inclusion $i_2 : k \to k[X,Y]$, and the identity
      function $\rid : k \to k$. What functions $f : k[X,Y] \to k$ are there that have the property
      that $f \o i_2 = \rid$?<br>
      <img src="picture2.png">
      <b>Answer</b>: As before, the value of $f$ on any element of $k$ is fixed by the constraint
      that $f i_2 = \rid$. But $f's$ values on $X$ and $Y$
      are completely free, and can be chosen independently of one another.
      Therefore there are $5^2 = 25$ possible $f$. One where $f(X) = a, f(Y) = b$,
      one where $f(X) = c, f(Y) = c$, one where $f(X) = e, f(Y) = a$, and so on,
      one for every choice of where $X$ and $Y$ land in the set $k$.
      <h2>The Relative Point of View</h2>
      We will want to treat the entire function from $k$ to $k[X]$ as a single coherent thing.
      For any set $k$, say that a <b>$k$-space</b> is a set $S$ together with a map $k \to S$.
      So, for example, the set $k[X]$ together with $i_1$ is a $k$-space. the set $k[X,Y]$
      together with $i_2$ is a $k$-space. The set $k$ together with $\rid$ is a $k$-space.
    <p>
      We abbreviate these spaces by referring to them as $\sp$ of their carrier set.
      So $\sp(k[X])$ means the $k$-space consisting of $k[X]$ and the function $i_1$.
      <h2>Space is Algebra Backwards</h2>
      We also want to define a <b>map between $k$-spaces</b>, but to do so in such a way
      that is "backwards". If $j_1 : k \to S_1$ and $j_2 : k \to S_2$ are $k$-spaces,
      we say that a map from $\sp(S_1) = (S_1, j_1)$ to $\sp(S_2) = (S_2, j_2)$ is a map $h : S_2 \to S_1$ such that $h \o j_2 = j_1$.
      <br><img src="picture3.png">
    <p>
      So what our earlier questions amount to are:
      <br><b>Question</b>: How many maps are there from $\sp(k)$ to $\sp(k[X])$?
      <br><b>Answer</b>: 5, one for every element of $k$.
      <br>
      <br><b>Question</b>: How many maps are there from $\sp(k)$ to $\sp(k[X,Y])$?
      <br><b>Answer</b>: 25, one for every pair of elements of $k$.
    <p>
      It can be seen that the number of maps from $\sp(k)$ to $\sp(k[X_1,\ldots,X_n])$
      is $5^n$, corresponding to the set of all $n$-tuples of elements taken from $k$.
      We contemplate this fact and interpret it as telling us that
      <blockquote>
        $\sp(k[X_1,\ldots,X_n])$ is in some sense an $n$-dimensional space, which has $k^n$ points
      </blockquote>
      and draw some suggestive pictures:
      <br><img src="picture4.png"><br>
      We start with the intuition that $\sp(k)$ is itself, a space consisting of one point.
      The points belonging to another spaces $\sp(S)$ are "ways of injecting a space into a point",
      i.e. maps $\sp(k) \to \sp(S)$, i.e. functions $S \to k$ making the appropriate triangle
      commute.
      <h2>Lines in Spaces</h2>
      With this intuition, we can ask questions that feel more genuinely geometric. For
      example: how many lines are there in a plane?
      <br>
      By a line we mean a 1-dimensional space, so we must mean $\sp(k[X])$. By
      a plane we mean a 2-dimensional space, so we must mean $\sp(k[X,Y])$.
      By "locating a line within the plane", we mean a map from the line to the plane:
      a map from $\sp(k[X])$ to $\sp(k[X,Y])$. Therefore:
      <br><b>Question</b>: How many ways can we map a line into the plane?
      <br><b>Answer</b>: As many as there are maps $f : k[X,Y] \to k[X]$ such that
      $f \o i_2 = i_1$. As before, the requirement that $f \o i_2 = i_1$ means
      that the value of $f$ on any of $\{a,b,c,d,e\}$ is determined, but
      we have a free choice of $f's$ value on $X$ and $Y$. And we can map
      each of $X$ or $Y$ to any element in the set $\{a,b,c,d,e,X\}$. So there
      are a total of $(5+1)^2 = 36$ ways of mapping a line into the plane.
      Here are some examples:
