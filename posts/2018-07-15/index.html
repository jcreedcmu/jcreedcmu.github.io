	 <h1>Action/Proposition Logic</h1>

    As I was noodling around with the ideas in <a href="">the previous
      post</a>, it really seems like
    fact <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~fp/papers/mfps99.pdf">the
      sequent calculus for ordered logic as described by Pfenning and
      Polakow</a> and dynamic logic ought to be overlapping subsets of a
    single logic that is a common generalization of both. But I can't
    quite figure out how! Here's a point where I regrettably really
    don't know the literature enough, and it seems very possible that
    someone has already written this down. I
    asked <a href="http://lpcs.math.msu.su/~sk/">Stepan</a> about it
    while at FLoC, and he referred me at least
    to <a href="http://buszko.home.amu.edu.pl/actlog2.pdf">Buszkowski's
      work</a> and
    some <a href="http://boole.stanford.edu/pub/jelia.pdf">old stuff
      by Vaughan Pratt</a> from the early 90s.

    <p/> Nonetheless I'm just going to forge ahead, as I usually do,
    seeing if I can work it out for myself from scratch!

	 <h2>Propositions and Actions</h2> As before, the underlying nature
    of the subjects of judgments in the system is such that
    propositions are <I>unary</I> properties of kripke-esque worlds,
    and actions are <I>binary</I> propositions. (The questions of what
    happens with $n$-ary relations, or what happens with
    higher-dimensional relation-like structures, are extremely
    interesting, but I reluctantly postpone them for now)
    Since additives don't care about, and merely preserve arity, I'm
    going to overload $\top, 0, \&, \oplus$ across the two
    syntactic categories..

	 The complete syntax of propositions $A$ and actions $\alpha$ is
	 \[A ::= 0 \celse \top \celse A \oplus A \celse A \& A \celse A \imp A \celse [\alpha]A \celse p \]
	 \[\alpha ::= 0 \celse \top \celse \alpha \oplus \alpha \celse \alpha \& \alpha \celse 1
    \celse \alpha \cdot \alpha \celse \alpha \rrto \alpha \celse \alpha \llto \alpha \celse ? A \celse \pi \]
    And the inference rules go like so, ignoring the additives $0,\top,\oplus,\&$,
    which contain no surprises.
    <h3> Action Atom</h3>
	 \[
	 \over
	 \Gamma, \pi, \Gamma' \prov \pi
	 \]
    <h3>Action Left</h3>
	 \[
    {	  \Delta, \Delta' \prov C

	 \[

    \qquad

    }
	 \]

	 \[
	 {\Delta, \alpha \prov \beta
	 \over
	 \Delta \prov \alpha \rrto \beta}
    \qquad
	 {\alpha, \Delta \prov \beta
	 \over
	 \Delta \prov \alpha \llto \beta}
	 \]

    <h3>Proposition Atom</h3>
    \[
    \over
    \Delta, p\prov p
    \]
    <h3>Proposition Left</h3>
	 \[
    {
    \Delta \prov A \qquad \Delta, B, \Delta' \prov C
	 \over
	 \Delta, A \imp B, \Delta' \prov C
    }
    \qquad
    {
	 \Delta_2\prov \alpha \qquad \Delta_1, \Delta_2 ,A, \Delta_3 \prov C
	 \over
	 \Delta_1, [\alpha]A, \Delta_2, \Delta_3 \prov C
    }
	 \]


    <h3>Proposition Right</h3>
	 \[
    {
    \Delta, A \prov B
	 \over
	 \Delta \prov A \imp B
    }
    \qquad
    {
	 \Delta, \alpha \prov A
	 \over
	 \Delta \prov [\alpha]A
    }
	 \]

    The cut principle for actions is
    <blockquote>
      If $\Delta_2\prov \alpha$ and $\Delta_1, \alpha, \Delta_3 \prov J$,
      then $\Delta_1, \Delta_2, \Delta_3 \prov J$.
    </blockquote>
    Let $\Delta_0 \ge \Delta$ mean that $\Delta_0$ arises from
    extending $\Delta$ by adding only propositions (not actions) to
    it, in perhaps various places in the middle.

    The cut principle for propositions is
    <blockquote>
      If $\Delta_0 \prov A$ and $\Delta, A, \Delta' \prov J$,
      and $\Delta_0 \ge \Delta$, then $\Delta_0, \Delta' \prov J$.
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Untethered Semantics</h2>
    The style of semantics I was giving before
    isn't quite the right thing to match up with this syntax, because it is <I>untethered</I>
    (see <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~fp/courses/15816-s10/lectures/17-tethered.html">
      frank's notes</a>
    and <a href="https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~bparente/jlc12.pdf">a paper
      by rob simmons</a> for more occurrences of this concept).
    But I'm going to describe it anyway, since it's a simpler version to get started with.
    One <I>could</I> give a sequent calculus for it, and it would involve thinking more in terms
    of never deleting things from the context, and instead merely manipulating cursors in it.

    Or one could of course go full simpson-style and just expose the
    worlds and relations directly in the syntax, while keeping it
    constructive. <p/>

    Recall that a proposition is interpreted as a function taking in a
    kripke world and spitting out a metalanguage proposition, and and
    an action is a function taking two kripke worlds, and spitting out
    a metalanguage proposition.

    The semantics of propositions would be
	 \[  0(u)  = \bot \]
	 \[(A \oplus B)(u) = A(u) \lor B(u)\]
    \[ \top(u) = \top \]
	 \[(A \& B)(u) = A(u) \land B(u)\]
	 \[(A \imp B)(u) = A(u) \imp B(u)\]
    \[ ([\alpha]A)(u) = \forall v . \alpha(u, v) \imp A(v) \]

    and of actions
	 \[1(u, v) = (u = v)\]
	 \[(\alpha \cdot \beta)(u, v) = \exists x . \alpha(u, x) \land \beta(x, v)\]
	 \[(\alpha \llto \beta)(u, v) = \forall x . \alpha(x, u) \imp \beta(x, v)\]
	 \[(\alpha \rrto \beta)(u, v) = \forall x . \alpha(v, x) \imp \beta(u, x)\]
	 \[0(u, v) = \bot\]
	 \[(\alpha \oplus \beta)(u, v) = \alpha(u, v) \lor \beta(u, v)\]
	 \[\top(u, v) = \top\]
	 \[(\alpha \& \beta)(u, v) = \alpha(u, v) \land \beta(u, v)\]
	 \[(? A)(u, v) = A \land (u = v)\]

    <h3>Incompleteness</h3>
    A counterexample to the completeness of this semantics relative to even
    the inference rules of pure ordered logic (i.e. not even requiring any use of $[\alpha]A$)
    is
    \[\alpha \llto \beta \rrto 0 , \beta \prov (\alpha \llto 0)\cdot \beta\]
    <p/>

    Clearly this isn't provable in ordered logic. If we assume
    $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are positive atoms, then we can't left focus
    on $\alpha \llto \beta \rrto 0$ for lack of $\alpha$, so we must
    focus on the right, spending the only $\beta$ we have.
    <p/>

    However, in the semantics, we suppose that we have some worlds $u, v, w$ and
    $(\alpha \llto \beta \rrto 0)(u, v)$ and
    $\beta(v, w)$, and we are to show $((\alpha \llto 0)\cdot \beta)(u, w)$.
    Expanding out definitions, what we have is
    \[\forall x . \alpha(x, u) \to  \forall y . \beta(v, y) \to 0(x, y)\]
    \[\beta(v, w)\]
    and we are to show
    \[\exists s . (\forall t . \alpha(t, u) \to 0(t, s)) \land \beta(s, w)\]
    so we pick $s := v$, let $t$ be given, choose $x := t$, choose $y := w$,
    and we're left with the obligation to prove
    \[ 0(t, w) \prov 0(t, v)\]
    and even though $w \ne v$, this is still provable, since $0$ at any interval
    on the left lets us finish the proof.

    <h2>Tethered Semantics</h2>
    What goes wrong with the immediately above example is that we are
    picking worlds to instantiate quantifiers that violate the
    assumption that when we do $\cdot R$, the context is
    actually <I>divided</I> and the two branches don't have access to
    the other half of the context. However, the semantics only adjusts
    some notion of where the endpoints of the context are from the
    point of view of the proposition on the right of the sequent: the
    universal quantifiers appearing on the left don't know what this
    interval is, and so can't restrict their choices to be inside it.

    <p/> To do a 'tethered semantics' in this case means that we want
    to be able to somehow propagate exactly that interval information
    from the right to the left. We will proceed much like
    like <a href="http://jcreed.org/papers/linear-modal.pdf">the
      tethered semantics of modal logic</a>, and polarize the syntax
    of propositions and actions, and use a linear token to keep track
    of the 'current context interval'.

    There are now four syntactic categories:

    <table>
      <tr>
        <td>$\textrm{Positive Props}$</td>
        <td>$A ::= \dns B \celse 0 \celse A \oplus A \celse p^+$</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>$\textrm{Negative Props}$</td>
        <td>$B ::= \ups A \celse \top \celse B \& B \celse A \imp B \celse [\alpha]B \celse p^-$</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>$\textrm{Positive Actions}$</td>
        <td>$\alpha ::= \dns \beta \celse 0 \celse \alpha \oplus \alpha \celse 1 \celse \alpha \cdot \alpha \celse ?A \celse \pi^+$</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>$\textrm{Negative Actions}$</td>
        <td>$\beta ::= \ups \alpha \celse \top \celse \beta \& \beta \celse \alpha \llto \beta \celse \alpha \rrto \beta  \celse \pi^-$</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    And there are four interpretation functions, with varying numbers of arguments,
    but all of them are kripke worlds:

    \[A_v \qquad B^t_{wv}\qquad \alpha^u_v \qquad \beta^{tu}_{wv} \]

    And we postulate some linear token $\#$ and define:
    \[ (\ups \alpha)^{tu}_{wv} = \ups (\# \otimes \alpha^u_v) \]
    \[ (\dns \beta)^{u}_{v} = \dns \forall tw.\ups (\# \lol \beta^{tu}_{wv}) \]
    Ah... No, I'm kind of confused at this point. My selection of which syntactic categories get which arguments doesn't seem coherent enough. Oh well!
