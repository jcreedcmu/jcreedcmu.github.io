	 <title>Polynomials as $n$-cells</title>
  </head>
  <body style="width: 800px">
	 <h1>Polynomials as $n$-cells</h1>

	 I want to articulate a way in which it
	 almost<a href="#almost1"><sup>1</sup></a> seems possible to
	 interpret almost<a href="#almost2"><sup>2</sup></a> any
	 multivariate polynomial function $f:\R^n \to \R$ as a
	 $n$-dimensional cell in an $\omega$-category. In a single
	 sentence, the crux of the interpretation is:
	 <blockquote>Read the graph of $f$ as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_diagram">string diagram</a>.</blockquote>

	 In what follows we'll assume all functions mentioned are polynomials
	 unless specified otherwise. <p/>

	 <h2>Example</h2>
	 Let $f : \R^2 \to \R$ be
	 \[f(x,y) = x^3 + y - 3x\]
	 We can graph it and interpret it as a string diagram like so:
	 <center><img src="diagram1.png"></center>
	 <p/>
	 The region where the function $f$ is negative is considered
	 an object $C$ of the $\omega$-category. The region where $f$ is
	 positive is called the object $D$. The points where $f$ is zero,
	 but $f_x$, the $x$-derivative of $f$, is positive, form two curves labelled
	 $F$ in the diagram: we interpret these as a morphism $F : C \to D$.
	 Places where $f = 0$ and $f_x &lt; 0$ we interpret as a morphism $U : D \to C$.
	 <p/>
	 Finally, the points where $F$ and $U$ come together in the diagram
	 are viewed as 2-cells. At the point labelled as the
	 2-cell $\eta :  \rid_{C} \to UF$, the function $f$ has the property that
	 $f = 0$ and $f_x = 0$, but $f_{xx} > 0$ and $f_y > 0$.
	 At the point labelled $\epsilon :FU \to \rid_{D}$, we have
	 $f = 0$ and $f_x = 0$, but $f_{xx} &lt; 0$ and $f_y > 0$.
	 <p/>
	 The intended interpretation of $f = x^3 + y - 3x$ is the composite 2-cell
	 \[ \epsilon_F \o F  \eta : F \to F\]
	 familiar from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjoint_functors">triangle identities of an adjunction</a>.
	 <p/>

	 <h2>Criticality</h2>
	 The crucial thing is to define which
	 points of the graph of $f$ count as 'exceptional', 'interesting',
	 'critical', i.e. where higher dimensional cells are happening.
	 There are various levels of criticality, one for each dimension.
	 For a point to be $k$-critical means that belongs to a $k$-cell in
	 the graph of $f$.
	 <p/>

	 We first have to define an auxiliary function $D^k(f) : \R^n \to \R$, for
	 any $f(x_1, \ldots, x_n) : \R^n \to \R$ and integer $k$ such that $1 \le k \le n$.
	 We say:
	 <ul>
		<li>$D^1(f) = f$</li>
		<li>\(D^{k+1}(f) = \displaystyle\det_{1\le ij \le k} {\partial D^i(f) \over \partial x_j}= \left|
		  \begin{array}{ccc}
		  {\partial \over\partial x_1} D^1(f)&\ldots & {\partial \over\partial x_k}D^1(f) \\
		  \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
		  {\partial \over\partial x_1} D^k(f)&\ldots & {\partial \over\partial x_k}D^k(f) \\
		  \end{array}\right|\)</li>
	 </ul>
	 We say a point $p\in \R^n$
	 is <em>$k$-critical in $f$</em> if $D^{\ell}(f) = 0$ for all $\ell \in 1,\ldots, k$.

	 <p/>
	 We say a point is <em>exactly $k$-critical</em> if it is $k$-critical and
	 not $(k+1)$-critical.

	 <h3>Checking Back With the Example</h3>

	 We can see that this definition lines up with what we were saying
	 in the example above. The morphisms are points that are
	 exactly 1-critical &mdash; the points where $D^1(f) = f = 0$, but where
	 \[D^2(f) = \left| {\partial D^1(f) \over \partial x_1 }\right| = f_x \ne 0 \]

	 <p/>

	 Similarly, the 2-cells are the points that are exactly 2-critical &mdash;
	 where $f_x = 0$, but where
	 \[ D^3(f) = \left|
	 \begin{array}{cc}
	 {\partial \over\partial x_1} D^1(f) & {\partial \over\partial x_2}D^1(f) \\
	 {\partial \over\partial x_1} D^2(f) & {\partial \over\partial x_2}D^2(f) \\
	 \end{array}
	 \right| \]

	 \[= \left|
	 \begin{array}{cc}
	 {\partial \over\partial x} f & {\partial \over\partial y}f \\
	 {\partial \over\partial x} f_x & {\partial \over\partial y}f_x \\
	 \end{array}
	 \right|

	 = \left|
	 \begin{array}{cc}
	  f_x & f_y \\
	  f_{xx} & f_{xy} \\
	 \end{array}
	 \right|

	 = \left|
	 \begin{array}{cc}
	  0 & f_y \\
	  f_{xx} & f_{xy} \\
	 \end{array}
	 \right|

	 = -f_{xx}f_y \ne 0

	 \]

	 <h2>Cells of the Putative $\omega$-Category</h2>


	 An $n$-cell is a function $f:\R^n \to \R$ that has no $(n+1)$-critical
	 points. <p/>

	 An $n$-cell is <em>trivial</em> if doesn't have any $n$-critical points.
	 <p/>

	 We expect that trivial cells act like equivalences: the domain
	 and codomain of a trivial cell can be identified.
	 However, we haven't even defined what the domain and codomain of cells are!
	 <p/>
	 We'd like to say something like: the domain of a morphism
	 $f : \R \to \R$ is
	 $f(-\infty)$ and the codomain of $f$ is $f(\infty)$. This isn't
	 precise, but since we said that functions that don't change sign
	 are trivial, we identify all positive 0-cells together, (calling
	 them collectively $C$ in the example above) and all negative
	 0-cells together (calling them $D$ in the example above).
	 Therefore it is more or less sensible to ask for $f(\infty)$ as
	 being either $C$ or $D$ according to
	 the sign $f$ asympotically reaches if you make its argument
	 arbitrarily large.

	 <h2>Questions</h2>
	 But obviously this is no good as a definition of a category if we can't
	 compose cells.
	 <ul>
		<li>Is there a nice way to define composition?

		<li>What is a complete classification of the set of $n$-cells up
		to trivial $(n+1)$-cell equivalence?
	 </ul>
