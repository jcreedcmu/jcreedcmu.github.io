    <h1>Typed Geometry</h1>
    I wanted to jot down some notes about some ideas that came from trying
    to teach myself a little about algebraic geometry again.
    <h2>Geometry from Algebra</h2> My beginner understanding of the
    big picture is that, by viewing rings "backwards", through the
    lens of a contravariant equivalence functor $\spec :
    \mathbf{Rng}^\mathsf{op} \to \mathbf{AffSch}$, we discover a
    landscape of interesting
      <i>geometric</I> objects: for example, the spectrum $\spec(\R[x,y])$ of the
      ring $\R[x,y]$ of
      real-coefficient polynomials in two variables feels like a
      2-dimensional space, even more so if we think of the important
      object as being the ring homomorphism that injects constants
      $\R$ into $\R[x,y]$. For if we pose the question of what $f$ in $\mathbf{Rng}^\mathsf{op}$
      make the diagram
    \[
    \begin{CD}
      \spec(\R[t]) @&gt;{\spec(f)}&gt;&gt; \spec(\R[x,y]) \\
      @VVV @VVV\\
      \spec(\R) @= \spec(\R) \\
      \end{CD}
    \]
      commute, we find that they are exactly the <i>curves</i> parametrized by polynomials
      that tell how to algebraically embed a one-dimensional space $\R[t]$ into a two-dimensional
      space $\R[x,y]$. This is because the diagram back in $\mathbf{Rng}$, namely
    \[
    \begin{CD}
      \R[t] @&lt;{f}&lt;&lt; \R[x,y] \\
      @AAA @AAA\\
      \R @= \R \\
      \end{CD}
    \]
      asks us for a ring homomorphism $\R[x,y] \to \R[t]$ that preserves $\R$: so the
      only choices we can make are assigning $x$ and $y$ to polynomials in $t$, just the right
      data to tell us how a curve wiggles around as we change the time variable.
      <h2>Geometry from Types</h2>
      I'm to understand that much of the interest of actual algebraic geometry is what happens
      when you take this idea and profoundly generalize it, studying also schemes (i.e. affine schemes
      patched together like you patch together copies of $\R^n$ to get manifolds)
      and quasicoherent sheaves and probably more things I haven't heard of.
    <p>
      I don't (yet) have any ambition to understand all that stuff
      type-theoretically, but I noticed the following interesting fact
      about types and parametricity and Grothendieck's "functor of points" approach.
    <p>
      Observe that we can straightforwardly write down, in dependent type theory, the type of rings as
      a record type.
      \[ \begin{array}{l}
      \mathsf{Ring} : \rset_1\\
      \mathsf{Ring} := \mathbf{record}\ \{\\
\qquad S : \rset \\
\qquad 0\ 1 : S \\
\qquad \_{+}\_\quad \_{\cdot}\_ : S\x S \to S \\
\qquad {-} : S \to S \\
\qquad \mathsf{plus\_assoc} : (a\ b\ c : S) \to a+ (b + c) \equiv (a + b) + c \\
\qquad \mathsf{times\_assoc} : (a\ b\ c : S) \to a\cdot (b \cdot c) \equiv (a \cdot b) \cdot c \\
\qquad \cdots\\
\}\\
\end{array}
\]
as well as the type of ring homomorphisms:
      \[
 \begin{array}{l}
      \mathsf{Hom} : (R_1\ R_2 : \mathsf{Ring}) \to \rset\\
      \mathsf{Hom}\ R_1\ R_2 := \mathbf{record}\ \{\\
\qquad h : R_1.S \to R_2.S \\
\qquad \mathsf{pres\_0} : f\ R_1.0 \equiv R_2.0\\
\qquad \mathsf{pres\_plus} : (a\ b : R_1.S) \to f\ (R_1.\_{+}\_\ a\ b) = R_2.\_{+}\_\ (f\ a)\ (f\ b)\\
\qquad \cdots\\
\}\\
\end{array}
\]
Therefore we can define $\spec$ as
      \[
 \begin{array}{l}
\spec  : \mathsf{Ring} \to \rset_1\\
\spec\ A = (R : \mathsf{Ring}) \x \mathsf{Hom}\ A\ R
\end{array}
\]
Now consider what functions $f$ there are that make the diagram
  \[
    \begin{CD}
      \spec(A) @&gt;{f}&gt;&gt; \spec(B) \\
      @VVV @VVV\\
      \mathsf{Ring} @= \mathsf{Ring} \\
      \end{CD}
    \]
commute, for rings $A$ and $B$, and for the evident projection from $\spec(\hbox{&mdash;})$ to $\mathsf{Ring}$.
Since $\spec(A)$ contains a type field (namely $A.S$) it's relevant to suppose that $f$ is parametric
polymorphic over that type.
<p>
In fact, we claim:
<blockquote style="background-color: #def; padding: 1em;">
<b>Claim</b>: asking for a <i>parametric</i> $f$ that fits in the above diagram is the same thing as asking
for a ring homomorphism $B \to A$.  That is, $\spec$ contravariantly faithfully embeds rings in the slice category of
types over $\mathsf{Ring}$.
</blockquote>

-->
Let's show that this claim is true.
<p>
The commutativity of the diagram means that the $\mathsf{Ring}$ part of $\spec$ is preserved,
so the essential data of $f$ we care about is really just a function
\[ g :\{R : \mathsf{Ring}\} \to \mathsf{Hom}\ A\ R \to \mathsf{Hom}\ B\ R\]

Let's construct the two directions of the equivalence we're claiming.
If we have a $g$, we can invoke it at the identity ring homomorphism $A \to A$,
and it outputs ring homomorphism $g\ \rid_A : B \to A$. In the other direction,
if we have a ring homomorphism $h : B \to A$, then all it takes is ring homomorphism composition
to make
\[ \lambda\  \{R\}\  k  . k \o h :  \{R : \mathsf{Ring}\} \to \mathsf{Hom}\ A\ R \to \mathsf{Hom}\ B\ R\]
<p>
Now we want to show both round trips are the identity. One round trip is easy,
the other one needs parametricity. The easy round trip is that if we start with $h : B \to A$,
lift to $\lambda k . k \o h$, and then apply to the identity, we get $\rid_A \o h = h$.
<p>
In the other direction, we start with $g$, we instantiate to get $g\ \rid_A : B \to A$, then we
lift, and we want to check that
\[ g \equiv \lambda\ \{R\}\  k  . k \o (g\ \rid_A) \]
with that equality taking place at the type $\{R : \mathsf{Ring}\} \to \mathsf{Hom}\ A\ R \to \mathsf{Hom}\ B\ R$.
By extensionality, we need to show
 \[(R: \mathsf{Ring}) (k : \mathsf{Hom}\ A\ R) \to  g\ k \equiv k \o (g\ \rid_A) \]
or in fact by another step of extensionality on the underlying function of $k$, this is
 \[(R: \mathsf{Ring}) (k : \mathsf{Hom}\ A\ R) (b : B) \to  g\ k\ b \equiv k\ ( g\ \rid_A\ b) \]

Now we turn the parametricity crank and find that the free theorem for $g$ is:
<blockquote>
Suppose we have two rings $R_1, R_2$, and a relation between them,
$\_\sim\_ : R_1.S \to R_2.S \to \rset$ <br>
Suppose the relation is compatible with all the algebraic operations, for example
$0 \sim 0 $, and whenever $a \sim a'$ and $b \sim b'$, we have $a + b \sim a' + b'$.
<br>
Suppose we have two ring homomorphisms $h_1 : A \to R_1$ and $h_2 : A \to R_2$ that are
pointwise related: for any $a : A$ we have $h_1(a) \sim h_2(a)$.
<br> Then $g\ h_1$ and $g\ h_2$ are pointwise related, i.e. for all $b : B$, we have
$g\ h_1\ b \sim g\ h_2\ b$.
</blockquote>

So we make the following choices:
\[R_1 := R\qquad R_2 := A \qquad h_1 := k\qquad h_2 := \rid_A\]
\[(r \sim a) := (r \equiv k\ a)\]
and the free theorem pops out $g\ k\ b \equiv k\ ( g\ \rid_A\ b)$, just what we needed.
<h2>What Have We Done?</h2>

Arguably this seems like merely a silly type-brained
way of proving the Yoneda lemma. I just demonstrated that the only way
to go from $\hom_{\mathbf{Rng}}(A, \hbox{&mdash;})$ to
$\hom_{\mathbf{Rng}}(B, \hbox{&mdash;})$ is by composition with $B \to
A \in \mathbf{Rng}$. No surprise there!
<p>
But! Something about this seems interesting to me in that it seems <i>really easy</i>
to talk about things other than rings in this way. I'm aware that there's
an active field of research into "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_with_one_element">what
 the field with one element could be</a>" and I get the sense it's got a lot to do with
choosing alternate foundations for defining what an algebra-geometric object is other than
the category of rings. Some crumbs from this story that I think I understand are
the fact that $\Z$, the initial object in $\mathsf{Rng}$, has somehow "too much structure",
and we'd prefer <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Borger%27s+absolute+geometry">a world in which</a> even the schemes that we call "absolute" are more relative,
e.g.  where $\spec\ \Z$ was "over" something else, call it $\mathbb F_1$.
<p>
While I don't think the above discussion provides any answers to the question of what that other foundation is,
it does seem to me like potentially a nice way to organize and compare such answers if other people have them.
Everything takes place in a background of simply type theory. One object can live over the type of
rings, another can live over <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.0083">the
 type of blueprints a la Lorscheid</a> or something, and
they can all get along together fine.
<p>
 Maybe
things like change-of-base by pullback across different such foundations makes sense. And in any case it's one more
nice application of parametricity, which I am always happy to add to my collection.
