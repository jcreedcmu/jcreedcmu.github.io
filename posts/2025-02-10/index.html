    <h1>An Imperfect Graph Representation</h1>
    Let's say "the type of (directed, reflexive) graphs" is
    \[ \mathsf{Grph} : \rset_1 \]
    \[ \mathsf{Grph} = (\E : \rset) (\partial : 2 \to \E) \to \rset \]
    The intuition here is that a graph is something which, if
    you give it a type $\E$ to represent an "edge",
    and you tell it where the domain and codomain are supposed to be inside $\E$,
    will spit out a type that is supposed to be the result of gluing together one copy of $\E$
    for every edge.
    <p>
      There are some constructions we can do from here that seem consistent with this intuition.
      We can define the one-edge and one-vertex graphs:
\[ \mathsf{edgeGrph} : \mathsf{Grph} \qquad \mathsf{edgeGrph}\  \E\  \partial = \E\]
\[ \mathsf{vertGrph} : \mathsf{Grph} \qquad \mathsf{vertGrph}\  \E\  \partial = 1\]
Let's say the "graph homomorphisms" $G_1 \imp G_2$ between two graphs $G_1\ G_2 : \mathsf{Grph}$ are the
maps that work uniformly for all $\E$, $\partial$, i.e. maps in
      \[ (\E : \rset) (\partial : 2 → \E) → G_1\ \E\ \partial \to G_2\ \E\ \partial\]
      Then we can say the vertices of $G$ are the homomorphisms from $\mathsf{vertGrph}$ to $G$
      and the edges of $G$ are the homomorphisms from $\mathsf{edgeGrph}$ to $G$.
      <h2>Faithfulness from Parametricity</h2>
      With parametricity, we can confirm some expected facts such as:
      the edge graph has exactly two vertices, its domain and codomain, and three edges, the reflexivity
      edges at its domain and codomain, and its one nontrivial edge. Why is this so? A vertex
      of the edge graph is a homomorphism from the vertex graph to the edge graph, so a function of type:
      \[ (\E : \rset) (\partial : 2 \to \E) \to 1 \to \E\]
      If the elements of the type $2$ are named $t_0, t_1$, then the only two functions of this type are
      $\lambda \E \partial \_ . \partial\ t_0$ and $\lambda \E \partial \_ . \partial\ t_1$.
      An edge of the edge graph is a function of the type
      \[ (\E : \rset) (\partial : 2 \to \E) \to \E \to \E\]
      And the only elements of this type are
      \[\begin{array}{l}
\lambda \E \partial \_ . \partial\ t_0\\
\lambda \E \partial \_ . \partial\ t_1\\
\lambda \E \partial e . e
\end{array}\]
For any chosen $V : \rset$ of vertices and $E : \rset$ of edges, and boundary function $d : 2\x E \to V$,
if we also have $\E : \rset$ and $\partial : 2 \to \E$,
we can define $G(V, E, d)$ to be the type which makes a pushout square of:
\[\begin{CD}
     2 \x E @>d>> V \\
      @V{\partial \x E}VV @VVV\\
      \E \x E @>>> G(V, E, d)
\end{CD}\]
If we write $[V, E, d] = \lambda \E \partial . G(V, E, d)$, then $[V,
E, d]$ is a $\mathsf{Grph}$.
<p>
By using parametricity we should be able to see that a graph homomorphism
\[[V_1, E_1, d_1] \imp [V_2, E_2, d_2]\]
is actually the same thing as a pair of maps $V_1 \to V_2$ and $E_1 \to E_2 + V_2$ that are compatible with $d_1$ and $d_2$.
(The $+ V_2$ is present because it is allowed to map an edge in $E_1$ into the reflexivity edge of a vertex)
By the pushout UMP, the main things we need to confirm are that
\[(\mathsf{vertGrph} \imp [V_2, E_2, d_2]) = V_2 \tag{*}\]
\[(\mathsf{edgeGrph} \imp [V_2, E_2, d_2]) = E_2 + V_2\tag{**}\]
In the $\mathsf{vertGrph}$ case, the only terms of the pushout that
we can build given $(\E : \rset) (\partial : 2 \to \E)$ are either $\binr v$ for some
$v \in V_2$, or else $\binl \langle \partial t, e\rangle$ for $t : 2$ and $e : E_2$.
But the latter is equal to $\binr (d_2 e)$ by the imposed pushout equality. So
the only real possibilities are $\binr v$, and we see the isomorphism $(*)$ holds.
<p>
In the $\mathsf{edgeGrph}$ case, we have one additional variable in the context, and we're
trying to build a term of the pushout given $(\E : \rset) (\partial : 2 \to \E) (\varepsilon : \E)$.
We can make $\binr v$ for $v : V_2$ as before, or else $\binl \langle \partial t, e\rangle$ for $t : 2$ and $e : E_2$
as before, which doesn't add any new real terms, but now we can do $\binl \langle \varepsilon, e\rangle$
for any $e : E_2$. So the isomorphism $(**)$ holds.

<h2>...But Not Adequacy</h2>

If the proof sketch above isn't mistaken, we have a <i>faithful</i> embedding of reflexive graphs into
the type $\mathsf{Grph}$ and the defined notion of homset  $\imp$. The homs between any two encoded
graphs are exactly the ones you expect.
This is superficially similar to taking the category $\G$ with two objects $V, E$ and two inclusions
$\mathsf{dom}, \mathsf{cod} : V \to E$ and one degeneracy $\mathsf{refl} : E \to V$ and considering the presheaf
category $\mathsf{Set}^{\G^\mathsf{op}}$.
<p>
But unlike that presheaf category, whose objects are <i>exactly</i> the reflexive graphs, there's a lot more junk lying
around in $\mathsf{Grph}$! For consider the "graph"
\[g_{???} : \mathsf{Grph} \qquad g_{???} = \lambda \E \partial . (\E \to \E)\]
Now consider the maps from this into the edge graph:
\[g_{???} \imp \mathsf{edgeGraph} = (\E : \rset) (\partial : 2 \to \E) \to (\E \to \E) \to \E\]
This is the church encoding of a type that is two copies of the natural numbers.
<p>
So this weird exotic graph object knows how to "fit into" each vertex in countably many different ways?

What's going on here? I don't have a clear idea.
