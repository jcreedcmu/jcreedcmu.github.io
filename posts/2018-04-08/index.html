	 <h1>Wellen's Synthetic Differential Geometry</h1> A couple
	 of weeks ago I went to a research meeting in pittsburgh with
	 various HoTT folks. One of them
	 was <a href="http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/fwellen/">Felix
		Wellen</A>, who gave a really interesting talk about doing
	 synthetic differential geometry using a modality. You can read
	 his <a href="http://www.math.kit.edu/iag3/~wellen/media/diss.pdf">thesis</A>,
	 or look
	 at <a href="https://ncatlab.org/schreiber/files/wellenDGinHoTT.pdf">these
		slides</A>, or
	 read <a href="https://ncatlab.org/schreiber/print/thesis+Wellen">this
		ncatlab.org summary written by his advisor</a>. I'm going to just expositorily
	 summarize what I understood of it, and add on a very conjectural
	 half-baked idea that I had following another really interesting
	 talk
	 by <a href="http://www.math.ku.dk/english/about/news/buchholtz/">Ulrik
		Buchholtz</a>.

	 <h2>What's the main idea?</h2>

	 In regular HoTT, it's cool that you get to do <I>synthetic
		homotopy theory</I> by just having types and identity types and
	 univalence: you don't need to do a bunch of set theory and
	 point-set topology to build up the structures over which homotopy
	 theory is traditionally defined, you can just have <I>types</I>
	 which, if correctly axiomatized, behave just like spaces up to
	 homotopy, and all definable functions in the type theory are
	 homotopy invariant.

	 Wellen's idea appears to be --- and I found this surprising and
	 exciting -- that it doesn't take very much
	 <I>additional</I> structure on top of the HoTT we know and love to
	 start doing synthetic <I>differential geometry</I>; basically, you
	 just have to assume the existence of some unknown modality.

	 <h2>What you get from modalities</h2>

    I mean 'modality' in the sense
	 of <a href="https://homotopytypetheory.org/book/">book HoTT</a>,
	 section 7.7, which really means (as is poitned out in the Notes)
	 an idempotent monadic modality, as opposed to say, comonadic ones.
	 I get the feeling this is common terminology for HoTT folks, but
	 with my logician hat on, I confess it always sounds weird, since
	 for us, a modality can mean just about anything; it's scarcely
	 more specific a term than 'type constructor'.

	 <p>Anyway, let's postulate a modality, call it $I : \rset \to
		\rset$, which comes equipped with a natural transformation $\eta_A
		: A \to IA$. The intuition is that $I$ takes a type, thought of as
		a space containing some elements that are infinitesimally close to
		one another, and, well, it
		<I>collapses</I> all points that are infinitesimally close to one
		another.
	 </p>
	 <center><img src="diag1.png"></center>

	 <p>Right away we can define the <I>tangent space</I> $T_a$ at a
		point $a \in A$. It's
 		<blockquote>
		  $T_\_ : \{A : \rset\} \to A \to \rset$<br>
		  $T_\_\ \{A\}\ a = (a_0 : A) \x (\eta a \equiv \eta a_0)$
		</blockquote>
		That is, $T_a$ is just the points in $A$ itself that are those
		that collide with $a$ after application of $\eta$, i.e. those
		that are infinitesimally close to $a$. We think of such an
		infinitesimal partner $a_0$ of $a$ as a tangent vector pointing
		from $a$ to $a_0$.
	 </p>
	 <center><img src="diag2.png"></center>

	 <p>We can define the entire tangent bundle $T_\infty A$ by just
		taking a sigma over all of $A$:
		<blockquote>
		  $T_\infty : \rset \to \rset$<br>
		  $T_\infty\ A = (a : A) \x T_a$
		</blockquote>
	 </p>
	 <h2>A baby theorem</h2>
	 Probably the simplest possible example
	 of what you can prove from this definition that illustrates how
	 the type structure gives you sensible things 'for free' is just
	 showing that functions from one type to another are
	 automatically 'differentiable'.

	 <p>What does this actually mean? That if you have a function $f :
		A \to B$, you get a map on the tangent spaces, $(a : A) (v : T_a)
		\to T_{f(a)}$. This is the derivative of $f$ in the direction $v$!
		<blockquote>
		  $\mathsf{deriv} : \{A\ B : \rset\} (f : A \to B) (v : T_a) \to T_{f\ a}$<br>
		  $\mathsf{deriv} : \{A\}\ \{B\}\ f\ (a_0 , (p : \eta a \equiv \eta a_0)) =
        (f\ a_0, \cdots)$
		</blockquote>
		where the missing path expression '$\cdots$' is a proof that
		$\eta f a \equiv \eta f a_0$. But because we have naturality for $\eta$,
		we know $\eta f a = f \eta a$, so this is the same thing as showing that
		$f\eta a = f\eta a_0$, which trivially follows from $p$ by $\mathsf{ap}$-ing $f$.
	 </p>
	 <p>Merely having a monad around, and doing utterly routine
		path-induction reasoning on paths, means us the fact that
		every function we can define is automatically differentiable! I
		think that's really cool.
	 </p>
	 <h2>A slightly less trivial theorem</h2>
	 Wellen's example in his slides of a theorem we can prove synthetically
	 goes like this:
	 <p>We can define
		an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-space">$H$-space</a>
		(i.e. a topological unital magma) as being a
		set $X$ together with
		<ol>
		  <li>$e : X$
		  <li>$\mu : X \x X \to X$
		  <li>$(x : X) \to \mu\ e\ x \equiv x$
		  <li>$(x : X) \to \mu\ x\ e \equiv x$
		</ol>
		and say that it's <i>left invertible</i> if
		$(x : X) \to \mathsf{isEquiv}(\lambda y . \mu\ y\ x)$. The theorem is
	 </p>
    <p><b>Theorem</b> Suppose $(V, e, \mu)$ is a left invertible
		$H$-space, and let $\mathbb{D} = T_e$ be the tangent space at
		the unit. Then the tangent bundle of $V$ is trivial, i.e. there
		is an equivalence $e: T_\infty V \to \mathbb{D} \x V$.
	 </p>
	 <p>And I can almost picture how you'd go about just hacking this
		up! The input to $e$ is essentially two infinitesimally close
		points, and you use the equivalence that constitutes left
		invertibility to transport this back to find a point
		infinitesimally close to the unit of the $H$-space, using
		again using functoriality of $T$.
	 </p>
	 <h2>Half-Baked Idea</h2> Later on Ulrik was talking about
	 topological groups and trying to encode <I>orientability</I> of
	 manifolds, which seemed to depend on sussing out the dimension of them as well.
	 <p>I was able to formulate the following, but I don't know if it's workable or not.
		Say an automorphism of the tangent space $T_a$ fixing the 'zero vector'
		is a <I>swirl</I> at $a$.</p>
	 <center><img src="diag3.png"></center>
	 <blockquote>
		$\mathsf{0}_\_ : \{A : \rset\} (a : A) \to T_a$<br>
		$\mathsf{0}_a = (a, \mathsf{idp})$<br>
		$\mathsf{swirls} : (A : \rset) (a : A) \to \rset$<br>
		$\mathsf{swirls}\ A\ a = (f : T_a \to T_a) \x (f\ {\mathsf 0_a} \equiv {\mathsf 0_a})$
	 </blockquote>
	 Then a <I>global swirl</I> of a set $A$ is a function $(a : A) \to
	 \mathsf{swirls}\ A\ a$, and a <I>loop</I> in the space of global swirls of $A$
	 is a map from the circle $\mathsf{S}^1$ to $(a : A) \to \mathsf{swirls}\ A\ a$.
	 <p><b>Conjecture</B> Under possibly further suitable axioms or
		assumptions, types $A$ that 'are 2-dimensional orientable
		manifolds' have the property that

\[ \mathsf{S}^1 \to (a : A) \to \mathsf{swirls}\ A\ a \equiv \mathbb{Z}\]

since it makes
		some intuitive sense to me that if you have to come up with a
		consistent amount of 'spin' across a whole 2-dimensional sheet,
		you have to either spin each tangent space around (clockwise or
		counterclockwise) zero times, or once, or twice, or etc., and if your space $A$
		isn't orientable at all, you'll only be able to not spin it, and you'll have instead

\[ \mathsf{S}^1 \to (a : A) \to \mathsf{swirls}\ A\ a \equiv \top\]
