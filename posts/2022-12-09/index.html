    <title>The Higher-Dimensional Graph Game</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>The Higher-Dimensional Graph Game</h1>

<h2>The Game</h2>
When thinking about what shapes to allow in the definition of higher-dimensional graphs, there is an interesting sequence of alternating quantifiers.
    As is always the case with alternating quantifiers, it's possible to understand it as the playing of a game between two players; or,
    to say the same thing a different way, a dialogue where the two parties alternate making choices.

    <p/>
    Let's imagine such a game between <span class="dan">Dan</span> and <span class="eliza">Eliza</span>. The outcome of the game is meant to comprise, at the same time, a
    <ol>
      <li>A <span class="dan">definition</span> of some higher-dimensional object, which will have vertices, and (something like) edges, and (something like) faces, and volumes, and so on.
      <li>An <span class="eliza">example</span> of such an object: an instance of the definition
    </ol>
    <span class="dan">Dan</span>'s choices determine the <span class="dan">definition</span>, and <span class="eliza">Eliza</span>'s choices the <span class="eliza">example</span>.

    <p>
      Here's a imaginary dialog of one way they could choose to play the game:

<table class="first">
<tr><td><span class="dan">$\ $Dan</span>:</td><td class="quote">What's the set of vertices? Let's call it $\mathsf \C_0$, the $0$-dimensional cells.</td></tr>

<tr><td><span class="eliza">$\ $Eliza</span>:</td><td class="quote">I'll decide $\C_0$ is the set $\{A, B, C\}$. We want there to be morphisms, $1$-dimensional cells,
in our structure, but I can't decide what they are until I know what their <b>boundary</b> is allowed to be in terms of the $\C_0$ I just decided on.
Let's call this $\B_0$, the $0$-dimensional boundaries. What's in that set?</td></tr>

<tr><td><span class="dan">$\ $Dan</span>:</td><td class="quote">I'll decide that $\B_0 = \C_0 \x \C_0$. Every $1$-cell will need a domain and codomain.
What's the set $\C_1$ of morphisms, then? I also want to know how to assign boundaries to all of them: I'll need a function $\partial : \C_1 \to \B_0$</td></tr>

<tr><td><span class="eliza">$\ $Eliza</span>:</td><td class="quote">I'll decide $\C_1$ is the set $\{f, g, h\}$, and I'll say that
$\partial f = \< A, B \>$ and $\partial g = \< B,C \>$ and $\partial h = \< A, C\>$. Now what's the set $\B_1$ of 1-dimensional shapes
that serve as boundaries for $2$-cells? I'll also need to know $\partial : \B_1 \to \B_0$ to know how these boundaries relate to lower-dimensional
ones. Hope you don't mind that I'm overloading $\partial$. </td></tr>

<tr><td><span class="dan">$\ $Dan</span>:</td><td class="quote">No
problem. As for $\B_1$, let me introduce an auxiliary concept.
Say $\P_1$ is the set of paths over $\C_1$. That is, an
element of $\P_1$ is a list $[f_1, \ldots, f_n]$ of elements of
$\C_1$, such that the codomain of $f_i$ (that is, $\pi_2 \partial
f_i$) is equal to the domain of $f_{i+1}$ (that is, $\pi_1 \partial f_{i+1}$). And I can define
$\partial : \P_1 \to \B_0$ by saying that the domain of $[f_1, \ldots, f_n]$ is the
domain of $f_1$, and its codomain is that of $f_n$. <p>
Now I can say that $\B_1$ is a <b>pair</b> of paths in $\P_1$, with the same boundary.
That means $\partial :\B_1 : \B_0$ has an obvious definition: just take either path, and return its boundary.
<p>
Now what's $\C_2$ and $\partial : \C_2 \to \B_1$?
</td></tr>

<tr><td><span class="eliza">$\ $Eliza</span>:</td><td class="quote">Ok, I'll decide $\C_2$ is the set $\{\alpha, \beta\}$, and I'll say that
$\partial \alpha = \< [f,g], h \>$ and $\partial \beta = \< h,[f,g] \>$. Now what's the set $\B_2$ of 2-dimensional shapes
that serve as boundaries for $3$-cells, and what's $\partial : \B_2 \to \B_1$?
 </td></tr>

<tr><td><span class="dan">$\ $Dan</span>:</td><td class="quote">To define $\B_2$, let me again introduce a notion of "path".
Say $\P_2$ is the set of pasting diagrams made up of cells from $\C_2$. [...]
</td></tr>

</table>

<h2>The Rules</h2>

The rules that Dan and Eliza are supposed to follow are these. There is an infinite number of turns, and
the sequence of them is the same in every game.
<table class="second">
<tr><td>$E_0$)</td><td><span class="eliza">$\ $Eliza</span></td><td>chooses a set $\C_0$.</td></tr>

<tr><td>$D_0$)</td><td><span class="dan">$\ $Dan</span></td><td>chooses a set $\B_0$.</td></tr>

<tr><td>$E_1$)</td><td><span class="eliza">$\ $Eliza</span></td><td>chooses a set $\C_1$, and a map $\partial : \C_1 \to \B_0$.</td></tr>

<tr><td>$D_1$)</td><td><span class="dan">$\ $Dan</span></td><td>chooses a set $\B_1$, and a map $\partial : \B_1 \to \B_0$.</td></tr>

<tr><td>$E_2$)</td><td><span class="eliza">$\ $Eliza</span></td><td>chooses a set $\C_2$, and a map $\partial : \C_2 \to \B_1$.</td></tr>

<tr><td>$D_2$)</td><td><span class="dan">$\ $Dan</span></td><td>chooses a set $\B_2$, and a map $\partial : \B_2 \to \B_1$.</td></tr>

<tr><td>$\vdots$</td></tr>

<tr><td>$E_n)$</td><td><span class="eliza">$\ $Eliza</span></td><td>chooses a set $\C_n$, and a map $\partial : \C_n \to \B_{n-1}$.</td></tr>

<tr><td>$D_n)$</td><td><span class="dan">$\ $Dan</span></td><td>chooses a set $\B_n$, and a map $\partial : \B_n \to \B_{n-1}$.</td></tr>

</table>
(For uniformity we could set $\B_{-1} = \top$, and have Dan and Eliza choose degenerate maps into $\top$ on turns $E_0$ and $D_0$)



<h2>Strategies</h2>
The thing I want to take away from the example play above is that everything Dan says still makes sense even if we change the particulars of what Eliza says.
That is, Dan's portion of the dialog hints at a description of a <B>strategy</b> for play for the entire game. The strategy is something like:

<table class="both">

<tr><td>On turn $D_0$,</td><td><span class="dan">$\ $Dan</span></td><td>sets $\B_0$ to be pairs of cells in $\C_0$.</td></tr>

<tr><td>On turn $D_1$,</td><td><span class="dan">$\ $Dan</span></td><td>sets $\B_1$ to be pairs of composable paths in $\C_1$, with $\partial$ being
the boundary of the overall path.</td></tr>

<tr><td>On turn $D_2$,</td><td><span class="dan">$\ $Dan</span></td><td>sets $\B_2$ to be pairs of composable 2-dimensional pasting diagrams constructed from cells in $\C_2$, with $\partial$ being
the boundary of the overall diagram.</td></tr>

<tr><td>$\vdots$</td></tr>

<tr><td>On turn $D_n$,</td><td><span class="dan">$\ $Dan</span></td><td>sets $\B_n$ to be pairs of composable $n$-dimensional pasting diagrams constructed from cells in $\C_n$, with $\partial$ being
the boundary of the overall diagram.</td></tr>
</table>

Even though I haven't been very clear about the exact choices Dan is making &mdash; I'm handwaving about what exactly an $n$-dimensional pasting diagram means,
and therefore I'm handwaving about what a higher-dimensional graph is &mdash;
I still think it's reasonably clear that

<blockquote>
A strategy for Dan in the above game in some sense is a particular definition of higher-dimensional graph
</blockquote>

Why is this? Because having a strategy in a game means having a witness for a proposition of the form
<blockquote>
<em>
"For every move Eliza makes, there exists a move Dan can make, so that for every move Eliza makes, there exists a move Dan can make, etc."
</em>
</blockquote>
More specifically, if we actually have a constructive witness

<table>
<tr><td>$\delta : {}$</td></tr>
<tr><td>$\forall (\C_0 : \rset).\exist (\B_0 : \rset).$</td></tr>
<tr><td>$\forall (\C_1 : \rset)(\partial : \C_1 \to \B_0).\exist (\B_1 : \rset)(\partial : \B_1 \to \B_0).$</td></tr>
<tr><td>$\forall (\C_2 : \rset)(\partial : \C_2 \to \B_1).\exist (\B_2 : \rset)(\partial : \B_2 \to \B_1).$</td></tr>
<tr><td>$\vdots$</td></tr>

</table>
(interpreting all the quantifiers as dependent types) then $\delta$ is
able to tells us what all the boundary shapes are for its notion of
graph, provided all the cells of lower dimensions with the appropriate
boundaries.

Furthermore the outcome of Eliza playing with Dan when Dan employs
some particular strategy amounts to describing a particular object
that satisfies that definition. We can think of Eliza's play as a term $\epsilon$ of type
<table>
<tr><td>$\epsilon : {}$</td></tr>
<tr><td>$\exists (\C_0 : \rset). \blet (B_0, \delta_0) = \delta\ \C_0 \bin$</td></tr>
<tr><td>$\exist (\C_1 : \rset)(\partial : \C_1 \to \B_0). \blet (\B_1,\partial,\delta_1) = \delta_0\ \C_1\ \partial \bin$</td></tr>
<tr><td>$\exist (\C_2 : \rset)(\partial : \C_2 \to \B_1). \blet (\B_2,\partial,\delta_2) = \delta_1\ \C_2\ \partial \bin$</td></tr>
<tr><td>$\vdots$</td></tr>

</table>

Since this is an infinite game, there is no moment when one wins and one loses, but the existence of a strategy $\delta$ for Dan
and a particular play $\epsilon$ by Eliza that is tailored to $\delta$ together imply that both players
<b>can</b> keep playing indefinitely.

<h2>Another Example Strategy for Dan</h2>
The example sketched above feels reminiscent of arbitrary pasting diagrams from category theory. We could give a different example strategy
for Dan where the result is instead more like semisimplicial types:

<table class="both">

<tr><td>On turn $D_0$,</td><td><span class="dan">$\ $Dan</span></td><td>sets $\B_0$ to be pairs of cells in $\C_0$.</td></tr>

<tr><td>On turn $D_1$,</td><td><span class="dan">$\ $Dan</span></td><td>sets $\B_1$ to be oriented triangles that have two composable arrows on one side, and a parallel arrow on the other, made out of "arrows" in $\C_1$, with $\partial$ being
the boundary of the overall path.</td></tr>

<tr><td>On turn $D_2$,</td><td><span class="dan">$\ $Dan</span></td><td>sets $\B_2$ to be oriented tetrahedra made from "triangle fillers" in $\C_2$, with $\partial$ being
the triangle at the base of the tetrahedron.</td></tr>

<tr><td>$\vdots$</td></tr>

<tr><td>On turn $D_n$,</td><td><span class="dan">$\ $Dan</span></td><td>sets $\B_n$ to be boundaries of ($n+1$)-simplices constructed from cells in $\C_n$.</td></tr>
</table>

<h2>Comparing Structures</h2>
We should have a way of talking about morphisms between structures. Suppose Eliza and Eve both play the game against the same Dan-strategy.
Suppose Eliza and Dan's game results in sets $\C_0, \B_0, \C_1, \B_1, \ldots$, and
Eve and Dan's game results in $\C'_0, \B'_0, \C'_1, \B'_1, \ldots$.
<p>
A morphism from Eliza's "graph" to Eve's should surely at least involve maps of cells $f_i : \C_i \to \C'_i$,
and we'd like to be able to assert that boundaries are preserved. But problematically, the boundaries
don't have the same types:
\[\begin{CD}
     \C_1 @>\partial>> \B_0 \\
      @V{f_1}VV  @VV{???}V\\
      \C'_1 @>>{\partial}> \B'_0
\end{CD}\]
I think we need to assume that Dan's strategy is suitably <b>functorial</b>, so that we can write
something like
\[\begin{CD}
     \C_1 @>\partial>> \beta_0(C_0) \\
      @V{f_1}VV  @VV{\beta_0(f_0)}V\\
      \C'_1 @>>{\partial}> \beta_0(C'_0)
\end{CD}\]
with  $\beta_0$ being a functor $\rset \to \rset$ such that $\B_0 = \beta(C_0)$ and $\B'_0 = \beta(C'_0)$.
<h2>Generalizing to a Category</h2>
This suggests that we needn't focus on $\rset$. Let's instead pick a category $\CC$ with a terminal object $\top$.
Set $\B_{-1} = \top$.
The rules of the game are now the following: at time $n$,
<table class="second">

<tr><td>$E_n)$</td><td><span class="eliza">$\ $Eliza</span></td><td>chooses a object $\C_n$, and a map $\partial : \C_n \to \B_{n-1}$.</td></tr>

<tr><td>$D_n)$</td><td><span class="dan">$\ $Dan</span></td><td>chooses a object $\B_n$, and a map $\partial : \B_n \to \B_{n-1}$.</td></tr>

</table>

What does it mean for Dan to have a <b>functorial</b> winning strategy for this game? To have a winning strategy
is a sort of liveness property.
<p/>
Dan has a strategy full stop iff there exists a "liveness" predicate on states such that
<ul>
<li> The initial state of the game is live.
<li> For every live state where it's Dan's turn, there exists a move to a live state.
<li> For every live state where it's Elizas's turn, for all moves, the result is a live state.
</ul>
To have a functorial strategy requires a kind of "lateral" Kripke condition in addition to these.
I'm not sure what it is, exactly but the intuition is that
<ul>
<li> For every live state where it's Dan's turn, if Eliza changes her mind about any of her past moves,
we can somehow fill in 2-cells to smoothly/functorially accomodate this time-travel/retrodiction/parallel-universe-slide.
</ul>
Anyway that thought sure went off the deep end! Maybe should think more about this later.
