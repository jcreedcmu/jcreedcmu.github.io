    <h1>Some Animation I Like</h1>

    Here are several animators and some examples of their work from
    the last decade or so.

    <h2>Cyriak</h2>
    <b>Example</b>: <em>Cows &amp; Cows &amp; Cows</em> (2010)
    <br>
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FavUpD_IjVY" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <br>
    Also a fine composer of dissonant electronic music, Cyriak's
    visual style is unmistakable: playfully terrifying reassemblages
    of animal parts, buildings, eyeballs, hands, etc. One thing that
    always gets me about the music in <em>Cows &amp; Cows &amp;
      Cows</em> is it sounds like it's in a weird meter, but it's
    actually in 6.

    <h2>Felix Colgrave</h2>
    <b>Example</b>: <em>Double King</em> (2017)
    <br>
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w_MSFkZHNi4" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <br>
    The visuals here seem really influenced by '60s posters and
    animations, but definitely far more idiosyncratic and interesting
    things going on than just being an homage. I love the organic
    lumpy-squishiness of everything. The humor is simultaneously
    philosophical and goofy as fuck, frivolous and full of existential
    horror. Also the sound design is sublime &mdash; I still get
    goosebumps from the chanting around 5:05, and every little
    environmental and incidental sound, every clank and foot-plap and
    buzz feels perfectly placed.

    <h2>Gooseworx</h2>
    <b>Example</b>: <em>Little Runmo</em> (2019)
    <br>
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ErQHVUQ6QCk" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <br>
    Gives me a very Newgrounds-flash-animation vibe, but more
    polished. Also some good existential horror mixed in with the
    jokes. I'm kind of a sucker for the "seeing into the
    behind-the-scenes" premise. Meatball man will haunt my dreams.


    <h2>Jonni Phillips</h2>
    <b>Example</b>: <em>The Final Exit of the Disciples of Ascensia</em> (2019)
    <br>
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8KfuFPlzEYc" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <br>
    The scribbly and scrappy animation feels just right for a
    bittersweet story about meeting aliens and starting a cult and
    making friends and having feelings. I've never been to art school
    but this is what I imagine it's like.

    <h2>Anna Scott</h2>
    <b>Example</b>: <em>Onions</em> (2020)
    <br>
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aO52131RTWU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <br>
    Can't believe this is just someone's final CalArts animation
    project. Brilliant, magical, efficient world-building in under
    five minutes. I want to watch a dozen more episodes. Such terrific
    sensitivity to motion and character.

    <h2>Victoria ("vewn") Vincent</h2>
    <b>Example</b>: <em>Cat City</em> (2017)
    <br>
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NWeyUpqnKuk" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <br>
    Hey. A cat tries to make it on his own in the big city. Love the
    aggressive flat colors that sit perfectly inside anxiously
    vibrating lines, in a world where style matters far more than
    trivial annoyances like one-point perspective.

    <h2>Ian ("worthikids") Worthington</h2>
    <b>Example</b>: <em>Free Apple</em> (2020)
    <br>
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_F9EMbkvLBQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <br>
    Everything worthikids makes is pure gold, and more quotable than
    it has any right to be. ("I'm run of the mill!", "Dismiss the owl,
    your one lifeline!", "absolutely bog-standard old man",
    "I'm <em>very close</em>", "I do love a barter") This "King's
    Quest" pastiche featuring Justin McElroy of MBMBAM fame is spot on
    if you've ever played the old Sierra adventures. Also don't miss
    "Big Top Burger", "Witches on Tinder".


    <h2>Madeline Sharafian</h2>
    <b>Example</b>: <em>Omelette</em> (2013)
    <br>
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OCp_G6J0m6g" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <br>
    A sweet and infinitely rewatchable story of a bean-shaped dog
    saving its owner from culinary disaster. I don't make the rules,
    this is the official music video for Elis Regina's recording of
    "Águas de Março" now. I think this is the most delicious depiction
    of food in animation outside Miyazaki.
