	 <h1>Cache Types</h1>

	 Say a <I>cache type</I> is a triple of types $G, C, B$, with some
	 morphisms and equations to follow.

	 <p/>
	 But I want to start by describing
	 rough shape of the example I have in mind is. The type $B$ is
	 the type of the <I>base state</I>. Think of it as the type that
	 describes cells in a spreadsheet that have actual, concrete
	 numbers in them. The type $C$ is the <I>cache state</I>, for example
	 maybe $B \x (D + 1)$. It represents the whole spreadsheet &mdash; or, well, a funny kind of lazy
	 spreadsheet &mdash; where the base state is there, and also a "cell with a formula", a computation
	 that computes something <I>derived from the base state</I>, of type $D$. Suppose $f : B \to D$ is
	 the name of that computation. We say $D + 1$ because
	 we want to talk about times when the cache is empty, or otherwise invalidated. Finally,
	 $G$ is the type of <I>good cache states</I>. For example, $G$ can be set to $B \x 2$. It represents
	 the fact that the cache can be empty or full, but records the fact that <I>if</I> the cache is
	 full, there's only <I>one</I> correct value for it to have. The type $C = B \x (D + 1)$ includes
	 lots of inconsistent cache states like $( b, \mathsf{Just}\ d)$, when
	  $d \ne f(b)$.

	 <p/>
	 So the morphisms and equations we require are the following:
	 <center><img src="diagram1.png"></center>
	 We require two retraction pairs, whose composite is also an retraction.
	 In our example, the injection $\iota : B \to B \x 2$ by always choosing the element $\mathsf{false}$ of 2;
	 the initial state of the cache is empty. The injection $\eta : B \x 2 \to B \x (D + 1)$ is defined by
	 \[ \eta(b, \mathsf{true}) = ( b, \mathsf{Just}(f(b)) ) \]
	 \[ \eta(b, \mathsf{false}) = ( b, \mathsf{None} ) \]
	 It describes what a good cache state is, concretely. Either a full cache, whose contents are consistent with the base
	 state, or an empty cache. The projection $\epsilon : B \x (D + 1) \to B \x 2$ simply throws away the <I>data</I>
	 in $D$ and just returns the bit of whether the cache is full. The projection $\pi : B \x 2 \to B$ throws away even
	 that bit of information.
	 <h2>Morphisms</h2>

	 The point of setting up these definitions is to be able to talk about the <I>morphisms</I> in a category whose
	 objects are cache types. I'll say a morphism from $(G, C, B)$ to $(G', C', B')$ is a triple
	 of morphisms that make the following diagram commute:
	 <center><img src="diagram2.png"></center>
	 The important one is $h$; because of the other arrows being mono/epi, the morphisms
	 $\hat h$ and $\check h$ are uniquely determined, if any such arrows exist and fit into
	 their place in the commutative diagram.
	 <p/>
	 Let's first talk about why these commutative squares are being required, and then
	 why the squares that <I>aren't</I> required, aren't required.
	 <p/>

	 The top square essentially says: If we have a good cache state,
	 and we inject that into $C$, and do some consistent computation to
	 it, it should also result in a good state. This is a sensible abstract "preserves a property"
	 kind of requirement when we think of $C$ as the <I>implementation type</I> of the caching
	 discipline. The morphism $h$ is the <I>actual concrete program</I> we run, and the
	 potential existence of $\hat h$ is a mathematical abstraction guaranteeing (part of) its correctness.
	 <p/>

	 The bottom square is saying: if we do some computation and lose the cache, we should
	 still have the same underlying data as if we had lost the cache earlier, and done
	 the underlying comptuation on the base state.
	 <p/>

	 Now for the squares we <I>didn't</I> require:
	 <center><img src="diagram3.png"></center>
	 The top square of this would require that our main computation $h$ does <I>not</I> depend
	 on the <I>value</I> in of the cache, that it can be represented as merely a function $G \to G'$. But this
	 deprives us from expressing computations whose intention is to <I>use a cached value</I>, as opposed to
	 <I>recomputing</I> it from the base state. And that's point of this whole exercise!
	 <p/>

	 The bottom square is telling us that if we <I>initialize</I> the
	 cache from some base state, and do some computation with it, that
	 has to be the same as doing the "raw" computation, and then
	 initializing the cache. This would undesirably prevent us from
	 doing computations that, e.g. do nothing but simply transition the
	 cache from empty to full by performing the expensive operation
	 whose output we want cached.

	 <h2>Expressing Morphisms Another Way</h2>
	 Instead of demanding triples, we can express the existence of
	 $\hat h$ and $\check h$ equationally in terms of $h$. We can require
	 <ul>
		<li>$h \eta = \eta' \epsilon' h \eta $
		<li>$\pi' \epsilon' h = \pi' \epsilon' h \eta \iota \pi \epsilon$
	 </ul>
	 because when this happens we can set
	 <ul>
		<li>$\hat h =  \epsilon' h \eta $
		<li>$\check h = \pi' \epsilon' h \eta \iota $
	 </ul>
	 Conversely, whenever we have $\hat h$ and $\check h$ satisfying the diagram above
	 <ul>
		<li>$\eta' \hat h =   h \eta $
		<li>$\check h \pi \epsilon = \pi' \epsilon' h  $
	 </ul>
	 it's just a matter of composing on
	 <ul>
		<li>$\epsilon' \eta' \hat h =  \epsilon'  h \eta $
		<li>$\check h \pi \epsilon \eta \iota= \pi' \epsilon' h  \eta \iota$
	 </ul>
	 and then using the retraction equations to get back the requirements above.
	 <h2>Resummary</h2>
	 The category of cache-types has for objects triples of sets $(G, C, B)$ such that
	 <center><img src="diagram1.png"></center>
	 and whose morphisms  $(G, C, B) \to  (G', C', B')$ are morphisms $h : C \to C'$ such that
	 <ul>
		<li>$h \eta = \eta' \epsilon' h \eta $
		<li>$\pi' \epsilon' h = \pi' \epsilon' h \eta \iota \pi \epsilon$
	 </ul>
	 <h2>Example</h2>
	 If we have a morphism $u : B \to B$, then a slightly nontrivial
	 example of a morphism from $((B \x 2), (B \x (D + 1)), B)$ to itself
	 is
	 \[ v(b, d) = \mathop\mathbf{if}  b = u(b) \mathop\mathbf{then} (b, d) \mathop\mathbf{then} (u(b), \mathsf{Just}(f(u(b)))\]
	 The fact that the equations are satisfied can be checked without any cleverness.
