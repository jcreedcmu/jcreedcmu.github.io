    <h1>Understanding the Hook Length Formula</h1>

    <h2>Some Definitions</h2>
    <p>
       A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_tableau">Young
       diagram</a> is a collection of boxes (or
       "cells") arranged in left-justified rows, with the row lengths
       in non-increasing order. We use $\lambda$ as a variable Young diagrams,
       and write $|\lambda|$ for the number of boxes in $\lambda$.

       <canvas  id="diagram1"></canvas>

       A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_tableau">standard
       tableau</a> on $\lambda$ is a way of putting
       the numbers $1,\ldots,|\lambda|$ in all the cells of $\lambda$, such that the numbers
       always decrease when we move down or to the right. We write $T(\lambda)$ for the set
       of standard tableaux on $\lambda$.

       <canvas  id="diagram2"></canvas>

       A <i>corner</i> in $\lambda$ is a cell that has no
       neighbors down or to the right. We write $C(\lambda)$ for the set
       of corners in $\lambda$.

       <canvas  id="diagram.corners"></canvas>

       The <i>hook</i> of a cell is the set of cells to the right and
       down from that cell, including the cell itself.

       <canvas  id="diagram.hook"></canvas>

       A <i>pointer tableau</i> on a Young diagram is a way of
       assigning each cell a "pointer" to some cell in its hook. In
       other words, a way of assigning numbers and a direction
       ("right" or "down") in some cells, such that if we move that
       many cells in that direction, we stay inside the diagram.
       Alternatively, we may leave a cell blank to mean that it points
       to itself --- and we <i>must</i> do so for corner cells, since
       they are the only cell in their hook. We write $P(\lambda)$ for
       the set of pointer tableaux on $\lambda$.

       <canvas  id="diagram.pointer"></canvas>

       An <i>strict pointer tableau</i> is a pointer tableau where
       all of the non-corner cells points to a <i>different</i> cell, not to themselves. We write
       $P^\x(\lambda)$ for the set of pointer tableaux on $\lambda$.

       <canvas  id="diagram.strict.pointer"></canvas>

       If $c$ is some particular corner of a Young diagram, then
       a <i>pointer tableau strict away from $c$</i> is a pointer tableau that is
       strict outside of $c$'s row and $c$'s column.
       We write $P_c^\x(\lambda)$ for the set
       of pointer tableaux on $\lambda$ that are strict away from $c$.

       <canvas  id="diagram.c.optional.recipe"></canvas>

       The
       "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hook_length_formula">Hook-Length
       Formula</a>" is a way of counting how many Young tableaux on a
       diagram $\lambda$ there are. It asserts:

       \[ |T(\lambda)| = {|\lambda|!\over |P(\lambda)| }\]

       Ideally, we'd like to prove this by a well-behaved
       ("combinatorial", "bijective") proof. That is, we expect there
       to be an explanation of the above identity between numbers by
       way of showing the existence of a bijection between sets:

       \[ T(\lambda) \x P(\lambda) \cong S_{|\lambda|}\]

       where $S_n$ is
       the set of permutations of $n$ things.
    <p>
       However, this is a bit hard to obtain. It seems to have been achieved in
       "A Direct Bijective Proof of the Hook-Length
       formula" [<a href="https://www.emis.de/journals/DMTCS/volumes/abstracts/pdfpapers/dm010104.pdf">Novelli, Pak, Stoyanovskii, 1997</a>] but I don't understand their paper yet.
    <p>I read "A Probabilistic Proof of a Formula for the Number of Young
       Tableaux of a Given Shape " [<a href="https://www2.math.upenn.edu/~wilf/website/Probabilistic%20proof.pdf">Greene, Nijenhuis, Wilf, 1979</a>] and tried to "bijectionify" it,
      and I found I was able to get a bijection

       \[ T(\lambda) \x P(\lambda) \x \Delta \cong S_{|\lambda|} \x \Delta\]

       for an 'auxiliary' set $\Delta$. I think in doing so I have recapitulated
       the algorithm in "A short hook-lengths bijection inspired by the Greene-Nijenhuis-Wilf proof" [<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0012365X8490027X?via%3Dihub">D. Zeilberger, 1984</a>].

      <h2>Lemmas</h2>

      There are two key bijective lemmas we need to establish. One is
      pretty trivial, and the other is arguably the central idea of [Greene,
      Nijenhuis, Wilf, 1979].

    <p>
      <b>Lemma 1</b>
      <em>For any $\lambda$ and $c \in C(\lambda)$, we have $P(\lambda) P^\x(\lambda) \cong P(\lambda - c) P^\x_c(\lambda)$</em>. <br>
      <b>Proof:</b>
      Given a pointer tableau $t_1$ and a strict pointer tableau $t_2$ and a choice of corner $c$:
       <canvas id="diagram.lemma1.before"></canvas> we swap
       some data between the two tableaux, namely all data
      in the row and column of the corner.  The only subtlety
       is that when we introduce strict pointer tableau data into the
       smaller diagram $\lambda - c$, we must remove any pointer that
       points to $c$, replacing it with a self-pointer, as shown in the red cells in
       the example below.
       <canvas id="diagram.lemma1.after"></canvas>
       This yields a pointer tableau $t_1'$ on $\lambda - c$, and a
       pointer tableau $t_2'$ that is strict away from $c$.
       This process is reversible. $\cqed$
    <p>
      <b>Lemma 2</b> <em>For any $\lambda$ with $|\lambda| = n$,</em>
      \[n  P^\x(\lambda) \cong \sum_{c \in C(\lambda)} P^\x_c(\lambda)\]
      <b>Proof:</b>
      An element of $n P^\x(\lambda)$ is a choice of "starting cell" in the diagram ($n$)
      together with a pointer tableau $P^\x(\lambda)$. We must produce a choice
      of corner $c$ and a pointer tableau that is strict away from $c$.
    <p>
      To determine the corner $c$, we take the starting cell and
      iteratively move according to the pointer tableau. This will
      inevitably lead to some corner.
       <canvas  id="diagram.lemma2.moves"></canvas>

       Now erase every number that occurs along the path taken, and flip the direction.
       If a path cell is in the row or column of the final corner, erase its direction as well.
       <canvas  id="diagram.lemma2.erased"></canvas>

       For each direction path cell left, follow its direction until
       you reach the row or column of the corner.

       <canvas  id="diagram.lemma2.selected"></canvas>

       We are going to "steal" from these cells in the row or column
       of the selected corner. If the "stolen" cell is pointing in the
       same direction as the path cell, we keep the same target cell
       that the pointer used to have, which means increasing its
       number. If it points in the opposite direction as the path
       cell, we simply move the "stolen" cell to the path cell's
       position, keeping its offset and direction intact.

     <canvas  id="diagram.lemma2.moved"></canvas>

     Here is the final state: we have produced a pointer tableau that is strict away from
     the corner $c$.
     <canvas  id="diagram.lemma2.final"></canvas>

     The reader can check that the procedure above is reversible,
     establishing that we have a bijection
      \[n  P^\x(\lambda) \cong \sum_{c \in C(\lambda)} P^\x_c(\lambda)\]
     as required. $\cqed$
    <h2>Main Theorem</h2>
      Now we can prove the main theorem. We write $\mu < \lambda$ when
    $\mu$ is a strict subdiagram of the Young diagram $\lambda$, and $\mu \le \lambda$ when it is a maybe equal subdiagram.

    <p>
      <b>Theorem</b>
      <em>For any $\lambda$, we have
    \[ T(\lambda) \x P(\lambda) \x \prod_{\mu \le \lambda} P^\x(\mu)\cong S_{|\lambda|} \x \prod_{\mu \le \lambda} P^\x(\mu)\]</em>
      <b>Proof:</b> By induction on the size $|\lambda|=n$ of $\lambda$. Observe that any
      standard tableau arises from a standard tableau with one chosen
      corner removed, so that
      \[T(\lambda) = \sum_{c \in C(\lambda)} T(\lambda - c)\]
      This means
\[T(\lambda) \x P(\lambda) \x \prod_{\mu \le \lambda} P^\x(\mu)
\cong \sum_{c \in C(\lambda)} T(\lambda - c) \x P(\lambda) \x \prod_{\mu \le \lambda} P^\x(\mu)\]
\[\cong \sum_{c \in C(\lambda)} T(\lambda - c) \x P(\lambda) \x P^\x(\lambda) \x \prod_{ \mu < \lambda} P^\x(\mu)\]
which by Lemma 1 is
\[\cong \sum_{c \in C(\lambda)} T(\lambda - c) \x P(\lambda - c) \x P^\x_c(\lambda) \x \prod_{ \mu < \lambda} P^\x(\mu)\]
\[\cong \sum_{c \in C(\lambda)} T(\lambda - c) \x P(\lambda - c) \x \left(\prod_{ \mu < \lambda -c} P^\x(\mu)\right) \x P^\x_c(\lambda) \x \prod_{ \mu < \lambda, \mu \not\le \lambda - c} P^\x(\mu)\]
which by the induction hypothesis is
\[\cong \sum_{c \in C(\lambda)} S_{n-1} \x \left(\prod_{ \mu \le \lambda -c} P^\x(\mu)\right) \x P^\x_c(\lambda) \x \prod_{ \mu < \lambda, \mu \not\le \lambda - c} P^\x(\mu)\]
\[\cong \left(\sum_{c \in C(\lambda)}  P^\x_c(\lambda)\right) \x S_{n-1} \x \prod_{ \mu < \lambda} P^\x(\mu)\]
which by Lemma 2 is
\[\cong n \x P^\x(\lambda) \x S_{n-1} \x \prod_{ \mu < \lambda} P^\x(\mu)\]
\[\cong S_{n} \x \prod_{ \mu \le \lambda} P^\x(\mu)\]
as required. $\cqed$
