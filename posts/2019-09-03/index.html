	 <h1>Some Thoughts on Story Games</h1>

	 I started reading a lot of
	 the <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/">story games forum
	 archives</a>. I'm not much of a rpg player historically, but there
	 are some really interesting ideas in there,
	 especially <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/profile/2097">2097</a>
	 ("Sandra")'s ideas about "blorb". I wanted to try to summarize
	 what I took away from it. Standard disclaimer that to whatever
	 extent I have good ideas, I owe a debt to the forum participants
	 for having articulated those ideas before me, and to whatever extent
	 I have dumb ideas or have misrepresented the ideas of others,
	 that's on me.
	 <p/>
	 Anyway the main goal here is to structure what I currently believe. Three bullet points,
	 followed by more detailed commentary:
	 <ol>
		<li>Table-top role playing games are interesting because they substantially combine
		  <i>formal systems</i> with <i>human judgment</i>.
		<li>Formal systems and human judgment in turn are interesting because they enable
		  capturing two different properties of <i>"realistic" fictional worlds</i>. Or,
		  to put it another way, they help achieve two different criteria of realism.
		<li>The "realism" so created still depends on using a certain
		  fuzzily-defined <i>subset</I> of formal systems, and a
		  constrained set of <i>human judgments</i>. Some formal systems
		  appeal to a human sense of <i>regularity</i> of how the world
		  works.
	 </ol>

	 <h2>What I mean by Human Judgment</h2>

	 Here is an example of a question that is a matter of human judgment:

	 <blockquote>
		<span style="color:#ff0000">What color is this text?</span>
	 </blockquote>

	 Almost certainly you will answer "red". I would answer "red". Here's another question:

	 <blockquote>
		<span style="color:#ff0020">What color is this text?</span>
	 </blockquote>

	 You might still answer "red", even though it is a slightly more pinkish red. I suspect
	 you'd be more likely to say "red" if I'd have asked this question first, and you didn't perhaps
	 imagine that I am trying to be sneaky.

	 <p/>

	 Human judgment is subjective, squishy, not perfectly consistent
	 across languages, not reliable from person to person, potentially
	 inconsistent within one person from time to time, and prone to
	 having a zillion special cases.

	 <p/>

	 With my blinkered ultraformalist mathematician hat on, it is
	 anathema; but it runs the (legal systems of the) world. It's fine.
	 Even though it smells incredibly unconstrained compared to math
	 and programming, it is not totally unconstrained.

	 <p/>
	 Here's an example of a game that depends on human judgment:
	 <blockquote>
		Alice chooses a fruit. Bob guesses a color. If Alice's fruit is
		the color that Bob guessed, then Bob wins. Otherwise, Alice
		wins.
	 </blockquote>
	 Note that:
	 <ul>
		<li>The question of what is or isn't a fruit is a question of
		  human judgment. Maybe a tomato is, maybe it isn't.
		<li>The question of what color a fruit is is sometimes but not
		  always determined by the choice of fruit. An apple could at
		  least either be red or gold or yellow or pink or green. A
		  strawberry is canonically red, even though an underripe one
		  might not be. A lemon is canonically yellow.
		  <li>As noted above, the question of whether one color is even
		  the same as another color is a question of human judgment.
	 </ul>

	 <h2>What I mean by Formal Systems</h2>

	 Phew, let's go back to something less scary and more comfortable.
	 Formal systems are, for present purposes, things that
	 can <i>mechanically</i> settle questions of what happens in a
	 game.

	 <p/>

	 Chess is a formally describable game; you can easily write a
	 program to input a list of chess moves and output whether they are
	 valid, and what the resulting board state is. Sudoku is a formally
	 describable one-person game.
	 Any game mediated and adjudicated entirely by software is a formal system.
	 <span style="color: gray">(I want to say "any video game is a formal system", but there's going
	 to be edge cases like Pokemon Go which also depend on gps sensors. An interesting case, to be sure,
		but a distraction from what I'm trying to get across)</span>

	 <p/>

	 A formal system has clean, sharp edges. A formal system operates
	 on discrete data types. A formal system is repeatable, reliable,
	 objective. A formal system is the same regardless of who's looking
	 at it, when they're looking at it, whether they like it or not,
	 whether or not they succeed or fail depending on its output.

	 <p/>

	 A caveat: this is an ideal. It may still require a modicum of
	 human judgment to <i>actually play chess in the real world</i>
	 because a player may put down a piece straddling the line between
	 one square and the next and someone has to adjudicate which square
	 it's <i>really</i> on. A player may fail to take a move for three
	 days, and even though you didn't specify a time limit when you
	 started playing, you know as a human being that this wasn't a
	 postal game and therefore this just <i>isn't</i> reasonable.

	 <p/>
	 But there is still an abstraction remaining that is <i>The Game of Chess</i> that we can
believe in as a fairly well-specified mathematical object, in a way that does not really hold at all for
	 <i>Guess the Color of the Fruit</i>.

	 <h2>1.</h2>
	 <blockquote>Table-top role playing games are interesting because they substantially combine
	 <i>formal systems</i> with <i>human judgment</i>.</blockquote>

	 Here's some things that might be said playing some rpg:

	 <ul>
		<li>In 1e D&amp;D, "Roll 3d6 for each of your stats." [Formal System]
		<li>In Lady Blackbird, "Add a die if you have a <b>trait</b> that can help you.
		  If that trait has any <b>tags</b> that apply, add another die for each tag". [A matter
		  of Human Judgment whether traits and tags &mdash; which are single words or short phrases &mdash;
		  apply to the current situation]
		<li>In Microscope, "Decide whether each description is Light or Dark,
		  whether what happens during that Period is generally
		  happy or tragic." [Human Judgment]
		<li>"The contents of the chest are determined by rolling a percentage die on the following table" [Formal System]
		<li>"If the result of the roll plus modifiers exceeds the
		armor's defense rating, the attack hits, otherwise it misses"
		[Formal System]
	 </ul>

	 Pretty much anything that really is, by necessity, a tabletop
	 roleplaying game, and not merely something that could be a
	 videogame that happens to be mechanically executed by a GM
	 following perfectly precise formal rules, has a substantial
	 mixture of (a) game-critical elements that depend on human
	 judgment, and (b) perfectly precise formal rules.

	 <p/>

	 The extreme of having all formal system and (nearly) no human
	 judgment still contains a tremendous, rich variety: any of
	 Chess, or Sudoku, or Go, or Backgammon, or Candyland.

	 <p/>
	 The extreme of foregrounding human subjective intuition, with very little formal structure
	 might be something like:
	 <blockquote>
		Hey, friends, let's just, like, make up a story. Anybody, whenever they think it's their turn
		to talk, says whatever they think would make a good addition to the story.
	 </blockquote>
	 There's nothing wrong with this! People write novels collaboratively sometimes.
	 <p/>
	 But there's something very interesting about the space between these extremes,
	 and it's something that, in particular, the story-games forum seemed to talk a lot about.

	 It's something to do with the feeling that, while playing, you are
	 interacting with something <i>real</i>.

	 <h2>Realistic Dragons</h2>

	 <i>Realistic dragons? What do you mean? Dragons aren't real.</i>
	 <p/> Over here we have a masterful painting of a dragon. The
	 dragon's scales are lovingly rendered, shining with an almost
	 metallic irridescence. The smoke rises in whorls above its
	 reptilian nostrils, lit by the flames rushing away from its mouth.
	 Its muscles are carved with an anatomist's sensitivity, its eyes
	 glisten wetly, its claws pierce the volcanic rock with palpable
	 tension.

	 <p/> &amp; over here we
	 got <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gz1DIIxmEE">Trogdor!
	 The burninator!</a> With consummate V's and a beefy arm.

	 <p/> Even though we know that dragons aren't real, there's
	 an obvious difference between a dragon illustration that <i>looks
	 real</i> and one that doesn't.

	 <p/>A "realistically depicted dragon" conforms to certain
	 expectations (its scales would reflect light much like snake or
	 lizard scales, it would have bones and muscles, it would appear
	 with the same perspective vanishing-point as other objects in the
	 scene) though not others (it might be able to magically fly despite its
	 implied bulk and small wings, it can breathe fire, it can
	 withstand direct contact with magma without harm) about
	 counterfactual animals.

	 <p/>The question of precisely <i>which</i> properties
	 that <i>are</i> satisfied by real animals have to be satisfied by
	 the dragon is not obvious, or objectively characterized. This,
	 too, is a question of squishy subjective human judgment. However,
	 there is some rough regularity and commonality to what people tend
	 to ask for in a definition of "realism" for paintings: things to
	 do with lighting, perspective, three-dimensional forms, anatomy, etc.

	 <h2>Realistic Worlds</h2> <p/>

	 Here are two properties of the real world as an interactive
	 system. They seem to be important for a <i>fictional world</i> to
	 seem like a <i>realistic depiction</i>, even though the world is
	 known to be fictional.

	 <ol>
		<li>The world is consistent. The world follows rules independent of the whims of its occupants.
		  Things continue to exist even when you can't immediately sense them.
		<li>The world is complex. One may investigate a phenomenon in the world, and
		  spend a great deal of time learning about its systems and subsystems, and still not plumb
		  the full depth of their complexity.
	 </ol>

	 Note that my belief in the full version of (1) being true of the
	 actual world, and my claim that most people expect this of
	 fictional worlds, is an <i>extremely</i> culturally conditioned
	 thing. It is specifically a very post-Newtonian thing to think.
	 But at
	 least <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_permanence">Object
	 permanence</a> is a thing; it's part of the toolbox of strategies
	 we use for coping with the world at human scales.

	 <h2>2.</h2>
	 <blockquote>Formal systems and human judgment in turn are interesting because they enable
		  capturing two different properties of <i>"realistic" fictional worlds</i>. Or,
		  to put it another way, they help achieve two different criteria of realism.
	 </blockquote>

	 Specifically:

	 <p/>Games that substantially depend on formal systems enable the
	 construction of fictional worlds that appear consistent, which
	 obstinately behave in certain ways indifferent to the whims of the
	 players, and this can be exciting to players because it makes the
	 game world feel <i>real</i>.

	 <p/>Games that substantially depend on human judgment enable the
	 construction of fictional worlds that appear complex, which a
	 player can interrogate, investigate, and explore, almost without
	 limitation, and this can be exciting to players because it makes
	 the game world feel <i>real</i>.

	 <h2>Blorb &amp; Garst &amp; all that</h2>
	 <h3>Blorb</h3>

	 It's time to start citing forum threads.
	 <p/>
	 <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/486144/#Comment_486144">Here
		is Sandra's "Mirror Story"</a>.
	 <p/>

	 A one-sentence summary: Sandra spent a lot of time playing rather improvisational, loosely structured
	 role-playing games, assumed without available
	 counterexample that all rpgs were just like that, then had a
	 notable contrary experience, and greatly enjoyed it.

	 <p/>The experience that sandra had was this:
	 <blockquote>
		[the party is in a classic dungeon crawl, and] there's an object
		behind a curtain. I walk up to it and put my hand under. feels
		like glass. "it's a cursed mirror?" we all think. we take it
		down from the wall w/o looking at it or removing the curtain.
		attach it to our cart.

		<p/> hours later, fighting against toad monsters on our way home
		from dungeon. we pull away curtain. one toad monsters sees the
		mirror and goes pop like a soap bubble just disappear from this
		world. and the mirror cracks.
	 </blockquote>

	 It took me a while to understand what was remarkable about this:
	 it's that the mirror <i>really was cursed the whole time</I>, and,
	 more importantly,
	 <blockquote>
		<i>the question of whether the mirror was cursed was already
		settled</i>, by a mechanism independent of any of the people setting
		at the table
	 </blockquote>
	 Presumably the DM of this game rolled
	 some dice on a random-dungeon-treasure table, as instructed by the
	 rulebook, and got "cursed mirror" (instead of, say, "regular
	 harmless mirror"). The choices the party made &mdash; to avoid
	 directly looking at the mirror, and also to attempt to weaponize
	 it during combat &mdash; were therefore an interesting and
	 consequential gamble. (For example, if it was a regular mirror,
	 they would have been wasting their valuable combat time uncovering
	 it)

	 <p/>
	 The mirror wasn't merely an improvised made-up fact. The fact that the mirror
	 worked as a weapon wasn't merely something the DM had thought would be cool.
	 It was a <i>consequence</i> of the impersonal, independent, impartial operation of formal system
	 which the players cleverly used to advance their own goals.
	 <p/>
	 This is, I think, roughly what Sandra means by "blorb".

	 <h3>Garst</h3>
	 <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/486311/#Comment_486311">Here
	 is Lumpley's "Mirror Story"</a>, even though it's about a wand,
	 not a mirror.
	 <blockquote>
		Our wizards had come into possession of a small collection of
		magical items. Meg, Emily and I brainstormed or otherwise
		generated a list of them, with no more information per item than
		"an embroidered shirt" or "a polished copper bowl." One of the
		items was a bone wand. We'd established that they'd come from
		the storehouse of a wizards' tower abandoned by its wizards, or
		something like that, and that's all we knew.

		<p/>

		My wizard
		undertook to figure out what the bone wand was.

		<p/>

		We had
		nothing prepped, we all knew that there was nothing prepped.
		[...]

		<p/>

		So here's my wizard,
		wandering around, waving this wand at things, working through
		the possibilities implicit in Ars Magica's in-fiction magic
		system. Meg and Emily are answering my wizard's actions
		whimsically at first, within those same bounds, then naturally
		starting to build organically on their collective previous
		answers.

		<p/>

		What happened in the real world was, at the same
		moment, with no communication between us, Meg's, Emily's and my
		imaginations converged on the same solution to the pattern
		they'd been whimsically / intuitively / symbolically /
		aesthetically creating.

		<p/>

		What it felt like was, the wand was
		real, and we all realized at the same moment what it really was.
	 </blockquote>

	 It's hard to know for sure what was going on without further
	 details about what the wand did, or what they concluded, which
	 information is not provided.

	 <p/>

	 But it seems clear to me that there is a form of <i>deduction</i>
	 operating here, even though it is not crystal-clear formal system
	 deduction. It's deduction from squishy
	 subjective-to-interpretation postulates about bones and wands and
	 perhaps trees and penguins stated with messy human language,
	 relying on "common sense" and shared cultural assumptions, and
	 shared beliefs about how physics works, and how magic <i>ought</i>
	 to work, if only magic were real.

	 <p/>

	 This sort of deduction, despite its unreliability in general to
	 produce crisp answers, can still under some circumstances produce
	 deductive consequences which are
	 <i>virtually certain</i>. This is the same as how I'm virtually certain you
	 <span style="color:#ff0020">won't say that this text is
	 green</span> even though you might say that it's pink or rose or
	 magenta or red-red-red-violet or something.

	 <p/>

	 The wand's nature wasn't merely an improvised made-up fact, even
	 though a lot of facts came into being in the game via "mere"
	 improvisation. It was something that came out of a sufficiently
	 rich tapestry of human-generated words and ideas and notions as a
	 <i>necessary consequence</i> of them.

	 <p/>

	 This is, I think, roughly what Lumpley means by "garst".

	 <h2>Blorb &#x2665; Garst</h2>

	 The thread
	 titled <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/22159/my-preliminary-hypothesis">My
	 Preliminary Hypothesis</a> suggests that blorb and garst are not entirely
	 inconsistent, and both contribute to a feeling of "realism" of
	 games. I'm presently inclined to agree.

	 <p/>

	 I think, however, that I also see why it's possible for a
	 particular player to enjoy one slant towards one or the other form of world-realism
	 much more than the other &mdash; to feel a sense of distrust towards the other mechanism.

	 <p/>

	 Someone who very strongly prefers blorb over garst might think like this:
	 <blockquote>How can I be sure that someone else's Mere Human
	 Judgment is going to produce the same result as mine? When you
	 talk about deduction from a bunch of facts that have already been
	 committed to, I can't really distinguish that from just making up
	 more facts. This breaks my sense that the fictional world is
	 realistic because it is <i>not consistent enough</i>.

		<p/> There had better be a definite predominance of the formally
		regulated parts of the world, and human judgment should be
		required only as a break-glass fallback last resort, to prevent
		hitting a dead-end when the players want to do something in the
		world that the rules didn't specifically
		anticipate.</blockquote>

	 Someone who very strongly prefers garst over blorb might think like this:

	 <blockquote>Why am I reading books and rolling dice and doing
		arithmetic if someone could just program a computer to do the
		same? And even then, why am I bothering to play such an
		impoverished game that is entirely mechanizable? What happens if
		I want
		to <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantGetYeFlask">Get
		Ye Flask</a> and the formal system I'm engaging with lacks the
		common sense to know that Ye Flask ought to be Gettable and just
		says opaquely that "You can't get ye flask!" without me being
		able to sensibly negotiate about that? This breaks my sense that
		the fictional world is realistic because it is <i>not rich
		enough</i>.

		<p/> The fictional world should be, within the bounds of
	 reasonableness, as malleable as possible. Formal systems should
	 only be required as a last resort when the natural flow of
	 good-faith collaborative storytelling negotiation breaks
	 down.</blockquote>

	 To be clear, I think even both of these caricatured extreme preferences
	 are totally fine to have, as well as a preference for an arbitrary specific levels of
	 compromise in between.

	 <h2>Blorb Mirrors and Unblorb Mirrors</h2>

	 There's a complicating wrinkle I want add to the above line of
	 thinking. It requires a little bit of lead-up.
	 <p/>
	 In <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21073/four-mirror-scenarios-and-two-groups">Four
	 Mirror Scenarios and Two Groups</a>, Sandra describes four ways her mirror story <i>might</i> have gone:
	 <blockquote>
		In common for all four scenarios: the players find a mirror,
		they believe it's dangerous, they treat it with the utmost
		respect, they try to use it as a weapon against bullywugs by
		tricking them into doing to what the players believe is a
		dangerous thing; looking in the mirror.

		"Harmless": the mirror is a scrying mirror that can spy into the
		lich's bathroom.

		"Dangerous": the mirror teleports whoever looks at it into a
		trap -- a trap that can be defeated, but can be lethal -- and
		then crack.
		<dl><b>H→D</b><dd>The mirror was harmless, but after seeing the players try to use it as a weapon, the DM decides it's dangerous for the bulliwugs.</dd>
		  <b>D→D</b><dd>The mirror was dangerous all along and the DM describes it consistently.</dd>
		  <b>H→H</b><dd>The mirror was harmless all along and the DM describes it consistently.</dd>
		  <b>D→H</b><dd>The mirror was dangerous, but after seeing the players try to use it as a weapon, the DM decides it's harmless for the bulliwugs.</dd></dl>
		(In our game, D→D happened. I've checked the module.)
	 </blockquote>

	 The rest of the post explains that to prefer "blorb" (or, in the
	 terminology of that post, to belong to the "Sandbox" group) is to
	 prefer that mirror should be <i>either</i>
	 <b>D→D</b> "dangerous all along" or <b>H→H</b> "harmless all along". It should be <i>something</i>
	 all along; the world should be a realistic (and therefore consistent) world, and not a world governed
	 by the DM's whims, "playing paper after seeing rock".

	 <p/>
	 That is, we want to demand, for consistency, that the game module has a sufficiently comprehensive
	 <i>rule</i> for how the object behaves, not leaving it up to the judgment of the DM. We might
	 imagine the book saying:
	 <blockquote>
		... on a 67, the treasure chest contains a <b>cursed mirror</b>.
		If the cover is removed, it cracks and teleports anyone facing
		it (if they are not blinded) to the pit trap on the seventh floor of
		the dungeon as described on p123.
	 </blockquote>
	 or, for a "harmless all along" mirror, it might say
	 <blockquote>
		... on a 67, the treasure chest contains a <b>scrying mirror</b>.
		If the cover is removed it reveals what's going on in the lich's bathroom.
		Roll 1d6 on the Table of Euphemisms for Going to the Toilet for what the
		viewer sees.
	 </blockquote>

	 <h2>Exotic Mirrors: Blorb or Unblorb?</h2>
	 However: Let's consider a third possibility:
	 <blockquote>
		... on a 67, the treasure chest contains a <b>adversarially semi-cursed mirror</b>.
		If the cover is removed and a <i>player</i> looks at it, it cracks and teleports them to the
		pit trap on the seventh floor of the dungeon as described on
		p123. If a <i>hostile dungeon creature</i> looks at it, nothing happens to them.
	 </blockquote>
	 We might call this, in functional programming notation,
	 <blockquote>
		&lambda; x. <b>case</b> x <b>of</b><br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;	| Player → <b>D</b><br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;		| Bulliwug → <b>H</b>
	 </blockquote>
	 or just <b>D | H</b> for short.

	 <p/>From the players' point of view, this is nearly the same thing as the
	 <b>D→H</b> mirror. If they look at it directly, it harms them, if they try to
	 use it as a weapon, it doesn't work.

	 <p/>And yet its behavior <i>is determined by rules</i> that have
	 been committed to before play occurs. The GM would in fact be
	 arguably engaging in the same sort of "cheating" if she were to
	 fudge the <b>D | H</b> mirror into a consistent <b>D→D</b>
	 or <b>H→H</b> mirror as she <i>would</i> be if she had fudged a
	 mirror that was consistent (according to her prior decision, or a
	 game module specifying it as such) into an inconsistent mirror.

	 <h2>3.</h2>
	 <blockquote>The "realism" so created still depends on using a certain

	 </blockquote>

	 Some formal rules, even if they are totally, absolutely, unquestionably formal rules,
	 with clear outcomes that no human whim can gainsay, nonetheless
	 <b>feel wrong</b>. They <i>feel</i> inconsistent, capricious,
	 irregular, inhumane, unrealistic.
	 <p/>

	 To really be a good "blorb" game that satisfies its players' sense of a realistic world
	 that is <i>consistent enough</i> you have to have not just a formal system, but a formal
	 system that feels sufficiently <i>uniform</I>.

	 <p/>
	 And to have a good "garst" game that satisfies
	 its players' sense of a realistically rich world, you nonetheless have to include
	 some principle of inductive uniformity in how you perform "human judgment". If you wave
	 the bone wand at five animals and it makes them double in size, then it would be
	 strange if you wave it at a duck and it shrinks it &mdash; unless there's a good reason why
	 ducks should behave differently.
	 <p/>
	 I'm not sure I have a good theory of which rules feel this way
	 &mdash; or <i>ought</i> to feel this way &mdash; but this is a recurring theme in lots
	 other domains. I think it's neat that this shows up in rpgs as well:
	 both the idea that <i>some rules are better than others by being more uniform</i>, and
	 that <i>determining what really counts as "uniform" is hard</i>.

	 <ul>
		<li>In <b>physics</b> generally, we have made a lot of progress by assume that
		  the universe evolves according to relatively simple and
		  well-behaved rules, even though it's sometimes contentious
		  what exactly we mean by "simple" and "well-behaved". The moon
		  falls toward the earth just as an apple does. Energy is
		  conserved. The laws of physics are invariant under lorentz
		  transformations.
		<li>In interpretations of <b>quantum physics</b> specifically,
		  we have experimental results that appear to depend on the
		  observer's choices about how the experiment is observed. Even
		  though there is a well-articulated and empirically validated
		  formalism that explains the outcome of the experiment, this formalism
		  persists in <i>feeling</i> otherworldly and counterintuitive to many, because
		  observer-dependence flies in the face of our expectations of nature proceeding
		  uniformly, and indifferently to its occupants.
		<li>In <b>law</b>, a feeling of fairness goes hand-in-hand with a law
		  applying to all people equally, but of course there is the
		  famous Anatole France quote about how "the law, in its
		  majestic equality, forbids rich and poor alike to sleep under
		  bridges, to beg in the streets, and to steal their bread."
		<li>In the <b>philosophy of language</b> we know intuitively
		  that the concepts of <i>blue</i> and <i>green</i> are
		  obviously natural, sensible concepts, and
		  that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_riddle_of_induction"><i>grue</i>
			 and <i>bleen</i></a> are monstrous and non-law-like. But how do we know this?
		<li>In <b>mathematics</b>, the idea of discontinuous functions was once controversial,
		  even though it's now easily accepted. To a mathematician of a bygone era, the function

		As a result, these people are all starving and living in poverty. Someone visits the planet and tells them, “Hey, why are you still using this anti-induction philosophy? You’re living in horrible poverty!”

	 <h2>The Feeling of Modal Necessity</h2>

	 A game can feel real when it feels as if there is a
	 non-person-like &mdash; or, more specifically, a world-like &mdash; player
	 which is playing with the players who are persons.

	 <p/>

	 We can draw a distinction between a thing that is character-like and
	 a thing that is world-like. Some assertions these:
	 <ul>
		<li>Characters have motivations, personalities, desires, vices.
		<li>Worlds don't have motivations. They are indifferent to characters' success or failure.
		<li>Worlds have rules. Worlds have state.
		<li>Worlds evolve. Characters act.
		<li>Worlds are large. Worlds contain multitudes. Worlds contain mysteries.
		<li>A character can be complex and subtle, but that's peanuts to a world.
	 </ul>

	 <h2>Computer Games vs. GM'ed Tabletop Games</h2>

	 If an ideal-blorb game has a system whose behavior is 100%
	 specified, then why even have a GM? Why not play a computer game?
	 In which an actual machine adjudicates all decisions?

	 <p/>

	 I think the answer is something like: to avoid "I don't know how
	 to do that" or "You can't get ye flask!".

	 <h2>Blorb &amp; Garst</h2>

	 Blorb is a way that a game can feel real, where there is a
	 precommitment to a system, and that system evolves in ways that
	 are independent of the players' (including the DM's, if any) capricious whims.

	 <p/>

	 Garst is a way that a game can feel real, where there is a large
	 body of committed facts about the game world, which have consequences
	 that are independent of the players' capricious whims.

	 <p/>

	 Blorb captures one bundle of qualities of "realistic worlds": their stability, consistency, indifference.
	 <br/>
	 Garst captures a complementary bundle of qualities of "realistic worlds": their richness, complexity, subtlety.

	 <h2> More Programs for People</h2>
	 <blockquote>
		Alice chooses a number between 1 and 10 inclusive. Bob guesses a number similarly. If the numbers are the same, then Bob wins.
		Otherwise, Alice wins.
	 </blockquote>
	 We don't specify the information hiding protocol (presumably
	 something like: alice commits somehow unfalsifiably, perhaps to
	 paper, bob says out loud, alice reveals) but it is inferred
	 naturally by the reader according to some quasi-Gricean tacit
	 rules.
	 <p/>

	 Given that, this seems like a fairly "crisp" and well-defined
	 game. However, in practice, Alice and Bob must still judge whether
	 a mark on paper is an 8 or a 3, and whether an audible utterance
	 was "five" or "nine" &mdash; these real-life avatars of abstract
	 meaning may be marginal.

	 <p/>

	 <blockquote>
		Alice chooses a fruit. Bob and Carol each guess a color. Anyone
		who guesses the fruit's color correctly scores a point.
	 </blockquote>

	 A common sense belief about a piece of fruit is that it has a
	 single color; if Alice chooses "apple", and Bob and
	 Carol <i>both</i> choose "red", then they are either both right or
	 both wrong.

	 <p/>

	 On the other hand, the game could specify that Alice is choosing
	 an abstract class of fruit, as opposed to imagining a single one.
	 In that case, maybe "red" and "green" could both be correct
	 answers.

	 <p/>

	 But there is something more blorby about the specific apple:
	 worlds are made up of specific things, not out of abstractions.

	 <h2>Programs for People</h2>
	 Here is a program. You execute it by reading it:

	 <blockquote>(1) Gertrude felt the back of her neck grow uncomfortably
	 warm. Her hands shook, and her breathing quickened. The beast was
	 near.</blockquote>

	 As a consequence of you executing this program, you imagine a
	 fictional person named Gertrude, who is afraid. This is because
	 the program is executing on a typical human brain, which knows
	 that shaky hands and fast breathing are symptoms of being afraid,
	 and that Beasts are usually scary.

	 Here's another program, which can be executed on the hardware of a human
	 brain plus a peripheral six-sided die:
	 <blockquote>(2) You feel the back of your neck grow uncomfortably
	 warm. Your hands shake, and your breathing quickens. The beast is
	 near. <br/> Roll a six-sided die. If you roll a 1, 2, or 3, the
	 beast jumps out from behind the pile of rusting bicycles, and
	 devours you. If you roll a 4, 5, or 6, you weave a network of
	 magic lines that dispells the beast's curse and restores her
	 original human form.</blockquote>

	 Here's another program:
	 <blockquote>(3) Roll a six-sided die. If you roll a 1, 2, or 3, you lose.
		If you roll a 4, 5, or 6, you win.
	 </blockquote>

	 Programs (2) and (3) have some structure in common. The human
	 executing program (2) understands that being devoured, and
	 "losing" are bad, and that breaking curses, and "winning", are
	 good.
	 <p/>

	 We could consider swapping "you" with "Gertrude" in these
	 examples, and could consider making Gertrude a "bad" character to
	 try to invert the normative valence of the outcomes.

	 <p/>
	 Here's another program, to be executed by two human brain processing units, named Alice and Bob.
	 <blockquote>
		In order to outrun the beast, Alice must run for 20 minutes without stopping.
		Bob must make a judgment as to whether he thinks Alice could do such a thing.
	 </blockquote>

	 <h2>Programs and Laws</h2>

	 When I was younger, I had a very unnuanced view towards all
	 digital intellectual property laws, a view that is very easy to
	 arrive at if you are fond of math, programming, and
	 unnuanced views about things.

	 <p/>The notion is this: since any particular piece of data is
	 essentially the same as a number, and sitting around playing a
	 pleasant game of "Hello This Is My Favorite Number Today What's
	 Yours" is <I>obviously</I> legal, and since <I>obviously</I>
	 there is no principled way to distinguish between this game
	 and "Hello This Is The Latest Version of Some Commercial
	 Software Have Fun", this must be legal also.

	 <p/>In short, I tacitly believed that if you can't make a
	 principled, crisp, mathematical distinction between two
	 circumstances, then you have no business trying to make any
	 distinction in that domain. It turns out that, in practice, the
	 law does not obey this principle at all.

	 <p/>Appealing to squishy, messy human judgment happens all the
	 time. It's necessary. Any particular thorny issue may have corner
	 cases where one person's judgment differs from another's
	 unpredictably, but there also exist plenty of cases where the
	 outcome is quite clear to any reasonable person.

	 <p/>Suppose someone is born on leap year, on February 29th. People
	 might argue whether they ought to be allowed to drink on the
	 February 28th that occurs 21 years later, or on March 1st &mdash; but
	 surely nobody would disagree that they shouldn't be allowed when
	 they're 4 years old, and everyone will agree that they should be
	 when they're 50.

	 <h2>Blorb</h2>
	 There's an interesting forum
	 called <a href="http://story-games.com/">story-games.com</a> that
	 I just found out about recently, sadly just after it decided to
	 close up shop. But for now they still have their archives up and
	 you can read them.

	 <p/>

	 In it there is a recurring theme, named <b>Blorb</b>, after
	 the <a href="http://www.ifwiki.org/index.php/Spells">enchanter
		spell</a>. The meaning attached to the term appears to have been
	 originated by story games
	 user <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/profile/2097">2097</a>
	 ("Sandra") and has been discussed and elaborated across many
	 threads.

	 <p/>

	 The basic flavor of it, I think, is that it's a binary property of
	 (story, role-playing, etc.) games. Some games are, more or less, blorb
	 &mdash; and some are unblorb. To be blorb is to succeed at conveying
	 the feeling that there is a certain type of
	 systematic <I>reality</I> to the game's state.

	 <p/>

	 But that's just a very brief summary &mdash; I think the idea has some
	 interesting connections to other classic issues in programming,
	 math, law, and philosophy, which I am going to try to explore
	 below.

	 <h2>The Mirror, and the history of RPGs, of which I am largely ignorant</h2>
	 First let's look at some primary sources for what blorb is supposed about.

	 <p/>The claim is that <I>this precise kind of experience couldn't
		have happened in other (i.e unblorb) styles of play</I>.
	 What other styles of play are we talking about?
	 Sandra says that her previous (considerable) experience playing
	 rpgs was either "improvised" or "railroaded".

	 <p/>In a heavily <I>improvised</I> game, the players and GM invent
	 facts about the world with comparatively little constraint. An
	 improvised game <i>could have</i> created exactly the same in-game
	 mirror story, as well: it could have been that Alice introduced a
	 covered mirror in the dungeon, and Bob said that now the party is
	 fighting the armies of frog fractions, and now Carol says the
	 party reveals the mirror, and Dave says that, by the way, the mirror is cursed, the frog creature is
	 teleported by the cursed mirror.

	 <p/>In a <I>railroaded</I> game, the game world has some notion of
	 state, but the GM can and does make, single-handedly, any
	 compromise to any pre-existing system or rules to ensure that The
	 Script is followed. The GM prepped a mammoth lurking in the
	 forest, but the party chose to ignore the forest and explore the
	 mountains instead? Fine, says the railroading GM, (though
	 secretly, to herself), it's a mountain mammoth now. Roll for
	 initiative!

	 <p/>Note carefully that the <I>in-game events</I> as described
	 could have happened precisely the same way. For sure an
	 improvisational game

	 <p/>However the <i>feeling</i> of this experience would be
	 different, because of players' understanding of what <i>could</I>
	 have happened, and why. Making up a story about a poker game is
	 not the same experience as playing a hand of poker, even if the
	 sequences of cards played coincide exactly.
