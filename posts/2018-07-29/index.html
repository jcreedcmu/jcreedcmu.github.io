	 <h1>Focusing and Ends</h1>
	 At this point I have a hunch that there is a nice theorem
	 saying <I>something</I> interesting about focusing and the
	 well-known-for-decades end/coend calculus, but I'm still
	 struggling pretty hard trying to figure out what precisely it is.
	 <p/>
	 Somehow the usual diagrams you draw about composing
	 extranatural transformations in a cycle-free way don't feel like
	 they're telling the entire story I want to understand.
	 Pairwise composability is one thing, but I want to know which
	 'big-step connectives' (in the sense familiar from when you talk about
	 focusing) are legitimate.
	 <h2>Some Things You Can't Do</h2>
	 The observations in this subsection aren't anything that isn't covered
	 by the "no cycles" rule, but I found it interesting to go over the details
	 of them.
	 <p/>
	 Some things that <I>aren't</I> sound, written as inference rules,
	 include
	 \[{F^{aa}_{aa} \over \exists b . F^{ab}_{ab}}\textcolor{red}{\times}
	 \qquad
	 {F^a_a \to G^a_a \over (\forall b . F^b_b) \to G^a_a}\textcolor{red}{\times}\]

	 Some conventions for how to read these: $a$ is a free variable in
	 every rule, an object of some category $\A$. There's an
	 implicit end taken, over this variable, over the top and bottom of
	 each rule. I'm writing ends as $\forall$ and coends as $\exists$.
	 Arguments to functors $F, G, H$, etc. are written as superscripts
	 if they're contravariant, and subscripts if they're covariant.
	 So, for example, in more usual notation, the first rule is saying
	 that if we have an inhabitant of
	 \[\int_{a\in \A} F(a, a, a, a) \]
	 for some functor $F : \A^\op \x \A^\op \x \A \x \A \to \rset$, then
	 we should also have an inhabitant of
	 \[\int_{a\in \A} \int^{b\in \A} F(a, b, a, b) \]
	 And, in fact, this <b>isn't</b> true! A counterexample is when $\A$
	 is the arrow category $d \to e$, and
	 <div class="tables">

	 Writing here $0$ and $1$ for the empty set and the singleton set,
	 with all the morphisms being uniquely determined.
	 <p/>
	 If you do the calculation, you find that the coend along the rightmost
	 two arguments (one covariant and one contravariant) gives you that

	 </div>

	 with the morphisms $\exists b .F^{db}_{db} \to \exists b .F^{db}_{eb}$
	 and $\exists b .F^{eb}_{eb} \to \exists b .F^{db}_{eb}$ being the
	 two <I>distinct</I> injections $e \to 2$. This means
	 that $\forall a . \exists b .F^{ab}_{ab}$ is <I>uninhabited</I> since

	 there's no 'consistent' way of choosing an inhabitant of $\exists
	 b .F^{db}_{db}$ (of which there is only one) and an inhabitant of
	 $\exists b .F^{eb}_{eb}$ (of which there is also only one) which
	 transport to the same element in $\exists b . F^{db}_{eb}$, which
	 is what the end-property requires.

	 <p/>
	 Similarly, we can find a counterexample for the other unsound rule above.
	 We take $\A = d \to e$ again, and set

	 <h2>Some Things You Can Do</h2>
	 Here are some rules that are sound:

	 You can use $\forall L$ rule at multiple variances,
	 as long as they're separated
	 by a product:
	 \[
	 F^{a}_{at^a_a} \x H^{at^a_a}_a \to G^{a}_{a}
	 \over
	 (\forall b . F^{a}_{a b} \x H^{a b}_a) \to G^{a}_{a}
	 \]
	 (where $t$ is understood to be some functor $\A^\op \x \A \to \C$,
	 and $F : \A^\op \x \A \x \C \to \rset$ and
	 $H : \A^\op \x \A \x \C^\op \to \rset$ and $G : \A^\op \x \A \to \rset$)
	 <p/>
	 You can use the $\exists R$ rule at multiple variances,
	 if the term you're substituting for the variable is itself
	 covariant or contravariant in its arguments, but not both at once:
	 \[
	 {F^{a}_{au_a} \x H^{au_a}_a
	 \over
	 \exists b . F^{a}_{ab} \x H^{ab}_a}
	 \qquad
	 {F^{a}_{av^a} \x H^{av^a}_a
	 \over
	 \exists b . F^{a}_{ab} \x H^{ab}_a}
	 \]
	 (where $u$ is a functor $\A \to \C$, and $v : \A^\op \to \C$)

	 <p/>
	 You can use the $\exists R$ rule for a term that is both variances at once,
	 as long as you only use it with one variance:
	 \[
	 {H^{a}_{at^a_a}
	 \over
	 \exists b . H^{a}_{ab}} \textcolor{red}{\star}
	 \qquad
	 {H^{a^a_a}_{at}
	 \over
	 \exists b . H^{ab}_{a}}
	 \]
	 You can do synchronous quantifier rules followed immediately by the
	 init rule, with arbitrary variances:
	 \[
	 {	 \over
	 (\forall b . F^{ab}_{ab}) \to F^{at^a_a}_{at^a_a}}
	 \qquad
	 {	 \over
	 F^{at^a_a}_{at^a_a} \to \exists b . F^{ab}_{ab} }
	 \textcolor{blue}{\star}
	 \]
	 <h2>A Thing You Can Do That Smells Strongly of Focusing</h2>
	 Finally, let me point out a rule that's sound that feels exactly
	 like a requirement that a positive atom "is already in the context".
	 It subsumes the rules marked $\textcolor{red}{\star}$ and
	 $\textcolor{blue}{\star}$ above.
	 \[
	 {
	  G^a_a \to H^a_{at^a_a}
\over
	 F^{at^a_a}_{at^a_a} \x G^a_a \to \exists b . F^{ab}_{ab} \x H^a_{ab} }
	 \textcolor{green}{\checkmark}
	 \]
	 It is worth comparing this to a similar, <span style="color:red">unsound</span>, rule with a cut baked in:
	 \[
	 {
	  G^a_a \to H^a_{at^a_a} \qquad G^a_a \to F^{at^a_a}_{at^a_a}
\over
	   G^a_a \to \exists b . F^{ab}_{ab} \x H^a_{ab} }\textcolor{red}{\times}
	 \]

	 Why is this unsound? Because if we replace $G$ and $H$ both with
	 the constantly-singleton set-valued functor, and choose the functor
	 $t^x_y = y$,
	 this becomes
	 \[
	 {
	  1 \to 1 \qquad 1 \to F^{aa}_{aa}
\over
	   1 \to \exists b . F^{ab}_{ab} \x 1 }\textcolor{red}{\times}
	 \]
	 which is just the
	 \[
	 {
	   F^{aa}_{aa}
\over
	    \exists b . F^{ab}_{ab}  }\textcolor{red}{\times}
	 \]
	 that we saw was unsound earlier.
	 <p/>
	 But critically, the difference between the
	 $\textcolor{green}{\checkmark}$ rule and its unsound partner is
	 the sound version resembles the focusing "big connective" rule
	 \[
	 \Gamma \prov [ H(a, a, t(a, a))]
\over
	 \Gamma, F^+(a, a, t(a, a), t(a, a)) \prov \exists b . [F^+(a, a, b, b) \tensor H(a, a, b)]
	 \]
	 that requires us to choose the instantiation for the existential quantifier
	 <I>and then immediately have the positive atomic proposition $F$
	 in the context already</I> in a way that's compatible with that
	 instantiation choice.
