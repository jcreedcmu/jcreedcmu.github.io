	 <h1>Towards a Judgmental Reconstruction of Dynamic Logic</h1>
	 <a href="https://twitter.com/chrisamaphone">Chris Martens</a>
	 posed a question the other day of what kind of nice
	 constructive/judgmental sense can be made of Dynamic Logic, and I
	 thought I'd write down my thoughts on at least how I think the
	 low-hanging-fruit part of it ought to go. Naturally, I'll use my
	 favorite everything-looks-like-nails hammer, which is taking
	 advantage of focusing to turn semantic clauses &mdash; as long as
	 you guess the correct "constructive semantics" clauses &mdash;
	 more or less automatically into inference rules.

	 <h2>Refresher on Dynamic/Epistemic Logic</h2>
	 Dynamic logic is a modal logic that I'd heard a
	 little bit about in the past, but I was never really intimately
	 familiar with it. Possibly this is because I hadn't encountered a
	 presentation of it in the style below, so it just seemed like one
	 of those "oh, it's kind of an interesting logic but it seems like
	 a big bag of classical axioms, so I don't really know what sense
	 it makes" kinds of things. The reference I'm using for some of its
	 features is the paper chris referred me
	 to, <a href="http://www.vub.ac.be/CLWF/SS/BER.pdf">A Logic for
	 Suspicious Players: Epistemic Actions and Belief-Updates in
	 Games</a>. I can divide the logical features going on in this paper into three rough groups:
	 <ul>
		<li>There's the purely epistemic-logic stuff: the $\square_a
		\phi$ modality which means "agent $a$ believes proposition
		$\phi$", and the common-knowledge $\square_A^* \phi$ which
		represents "every agent in the set $A$ believes
		$\phi$, <I>and</I> they believe every agent in the set believes
		$\phi$, and they believe they believe they believe $\phi$, etc."
		I'm pretty sure this can be handled with a suitably indexed
		Pfenning-Davies box modality, or a variant of it without
		reflexivity and transitivity
		via <a href="http://jcreed.org/papers/linear-modal.pdf">some
		focal encoding of modal logic</a>.
		<li>There's the ordinary dynamic logic stuff, which I am going to talk about below.
		<li>Then there's the really fascinating features that are
		  actually what this paper is mostly about &mdash; namely the
		  belief-update "agent $a$ suspects action $\alpha$" actions. I
		  don't think I'm going to be able to say much about this yet.
	 </ul>
	 <p/>
	 So the point of dynamic logic is that you have some type of <I>actions</I> $\alpha$, for which you can talk about
	 the proposition of $[\alpha]\phi$, thought of as meaning "$\phi$ is true after action $\alpha$ is completed". More
	 specifically, it means that <I>for any way of completing $\alpha$</I>, the proposition $\phi$ will be true afterwards.
	 <p/>
	 Right away we can start by defining some trivial actions,
	 \[\alpha ::= 0 \celse 1 \celse \cdots \]
	 with the intended meaning that $0$ is the action that's impossible to complete, and $1$ is the action
	 that has exactly one way to complete, and has no side-effects on the world at all. This would mean
	 that always
 	 \[ \prov [0]\phi \]
	 (for, indeed, for all ways of completing the action $0$, of which there are none, it's vacuously true that $\phi$)
	 and
 	 \[  [1]\phi  \prequiv \phi\]
	 We can also introduce a nondeterministic action
	 \[\alpha ::= \cdots \celse \alpha \cup \beta \celse \cdots \]
	 and we'd expect that
	 \[ [\alpha \cup \beta] \phi \prequiv [\alpha]\phi \land [\beta]\phi \]
	 In other words: for $\phi$ to be guaranteed to be true after a
	 process that might do $\alpha$, and might do $\beta$, is the same
	 as a guarantee that it's true in the event that $\alpha$ actually
	 happens, and a guarantee that it's true after $\beta$.
	 <p/>
	 There's also a notion of <I>sequencing</I> of actions:
	 \[\alpha ::= \cdots \celse \alpha \cdot \beta \celse \cdots \]
	 The intended meaning of $\alpha \cdot \beta$ is "do $\alpha$, and then do $\beta$". We'd expect the equivalence
	 \[[\alpha \cdot \beta]\phi\prequiv [\beta ][ \alpha]\phi \]
	 <p/>
	 Finally, we want to introduce a way for actions to interact with truth of propositions.
	 There is a <I>test action</I>
	 \[\alpha ::= \cdots \celse ? \phi  \]
	 with the intended semantics that the action $? \phi$ can complete (and has no
	 side effects) only if $\phi$ is currently <I>true</I>.

	 <h2>Semantics</h2>
	 The complete syntax of propositions and actions might then look like
	 \[\phi ::= \top \celse \bot \celse \phi \lor \phi \celse \phi \land \phi \celse \phi \imp \phi \celse [\alpha]\phi \celse p \]
	 \[\alpha ::= 1 \celse 0 \celse \alpha \cup \alpha \celse \alpha \cdot \alpha \celse ? \phi \celse \pi \]
	 where we include some atomic propositions $p$ and atomic actions $\pi$ to go at the leaves of the expression trees.
	 We want to define a translation of this source language into a more low-level ambient metalogic that we can think
	 of a focused proof-theory, and derive some judgmental-looking inference rules for $[\alpha]\phi$.
	 <p/>

	 This translation will be essentially a Kripke-style possible-world
	 semantics. We have a notion of worlds $u, v, w$, and the
	 translation takes in a proposition $\phi$ and a world $u$, and
	 spits out a metalanguage proposition. I'm going to write the
	 metalanguage propositional connectives as $\forall, \exists, \lor,\land,\imp,$
	 etc. and hope that no confusion arises from this overloading.

	 <p/>
	 I'll write this translation as $\phi \wat u$.
	 Let's jump right in and give a translation of $[\alpha]\phi$; we say that the meaning of it is given by
	 \[ ([\alpha]\phi) \wat u = \forall v . R_\alpha(u, v) \imp (\phi \wat v) \]
	 to make sense of this, we have to define $R_\alpha$, takes an action $\alpha$, and two
	 worlds $u$ and $v$, and spits out a metalanguage proposition. We define it recursively on $\alpha$, as follows:
	 \[R_\pi(u, v) = \pi(u, v)\]
	 \[R_{\alpha \cdot \beta}(u, v) = \exists w . R_\alpha(u, w) \land R_\beta(w, v)\]
	 \[R_{\alpha \cup \beta}(u, v) = R_\alpha(u, v) \lor R_\beta(u, v)\]
	 \[R_{1}(u, v) = u = v\]
	 \[R_{0}(u, v) = \bot\]
	 \[R_{? \phi}(u, v) = \phi \land (u = v)\]
	 where we postulate that every atomic action $\pi$ comes equipped
	 with some metalanguage binary relation $\pi(u, v)$ on worlds. The
	 interpretation of every other proposition besides $[\alpha]\phi$
	 (even implication! the Kripke semantics is not here to reify the
	 possible worlds of constructivism itself, but another layer on top
	 of a logic already assumed constructive) is just a boring
	 homomorphism:
	 \[ \top \wat u = \top \qquad \bot \wat u = \bot\]
	 \[ (\phi \land \psi) \wat u = \phi \wat u \land \psi \wat u\]
	 \[ (\phi \lor \psi) \wat u = \phi \wat u \lor \psi \wat u\]
	 \[ (\phi \imp \psi) \wat u = \phi \wat u \imp \psi \wat u\]
	 \[ p \wat u = p(u)\]
	 We do assume that every atomic proposition $p$ comes equipped with a metalanguage unary proposition
	 $p(u)$ on worlds.

	 <h2>Dreaming Up Syntax</h2>

	 So, having written down a "syntactic semantics", we imagine what
	 range of phenomena can possibly occur if we start with a
	 proposition $\phi$, compute $\phi \wat u$, and try to do proof
	 search on the result. Well, if $\phi$ is of the form $[\alpha_1 \cdot \alpha_2 \cdots \alpha_n]\phi$,
	 then we find
	 \[ ([\alpha_1 \cdot \alpha_2 \cdots \alpha_n]\phi) \wat u \equiv
	 (\exists w_1\cdots w_n. R_{\alpha_1}(u, w_1) \land \cdots \land R_{\alpha_n}(w_{n-1}, w_n)) \imp \phi \wat w_n\]
	 Or, up to logical equivalence, we could have also written
	 \[ ([\alpha_1 \cdot \alpha_2 \cdots \alpha_n]\phi) \wat u \equiv
	 \forall w_1\cdots w_n. R_{\alpha_1}(u, w_1) \imp \cdots \land R_{\alpha_n}(w_{n-1}, w_n) \imp \phi \wat w_n\]
	 This means that when we have a proposition like $[\alpha_1 \cdot \alpha_2 \cdots \alpha_n]\phi$ on the
	 right of a sequent, we will need to asynchronously unpack it into a whole sequence of information
	 about possible worlds and actions that transition between them. We therefore might guess
	 that the general form of the sequent of the source language is
	 \[\Gamma; \Omega \prov \phi \]
	 for $\Gamma$ being as usual a context of hypothesized propositions, and $\Omega$ being an ordered list of actions.
	 Semantically, we would say that the meaning of such a judgment is given by
	 \[(\Gamma; \alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n \prov \phi)= \]
\[\forall u . \forall w_1\cdots w_n. R_{\alpha_1}(u, w_1) \imp \cdots \land R_{\alpha_n}(w_{n-1}, w_n) \imp \Gamma \wat u \imp \phi \wat w_n \]
	 Since $\Gamma$ consists of hypotheses of the form $\phi\ \mathsf{true}$,
	 then $\Gamma \wat u$ would be the conjunction of $\phi \wat u$.
	 <h2>Inference Rules</h2>
	 We can make some progress by trying to start writing down inference rules
	 that decompose non-atomic actions in the context
	 $\Omega$. If we say
	 \[
	 \Gamma; \Omega, \alpha, \beta, \Omega' \prov \phi
	 \over
	 \Gamma; \Omega, \alpha \cdot \beta, \Omega' \prov \phi
	 \]

	 \[
{	 \Gamma; \Omega, \Omega' \prov \phi
	 \over
	 \Gamma; \Omega, 1, \Omega' \prov \phi}
	 \qquad
	{ \over
	 \Gamma; \Omega, 0, \Omega' \prov \phi}
	 \]

	 \[
	 \Gamma; \Omega, \alpha, \Omega' \prov \phi \qquad
	 \Gamma; \Omega,  \beta, \Omega' \prov \phi
	 \over
	 \Gamma; \Omega, \alpha \cup \beta, \Omega' \prov \phi
	 \]

	 \[
	 \Gamma; \Omega, \alpha, \Omega' \prov \phi \qquad
	 \Gamma; \Omega,  \beta, \Omega' \prov \phi
	 \over
	 \Gamma; \Omega, \alpha \cup \beta, \Omega' \prov \phi
	 \]

	 then we observe that the interpretation of all these rules are
	 justified by left-inversion rules in the metalanguage. Indeed, by
	 focusing discipline, we can require that these rules are applied
	 eagerly in the source language, until the entire context $\Omega$
	 consists of nothing but atomic actions and tests.

	 <p/>
	 But now we think about how to write rules for a test $? \phi$ and it seems
	 somewhat unclear with this syntax! Since $?\phi = \phi \land (u = v)$ is a
	 positive proposition, it should invert in this position, but our judgmental
	 apparatus so far isn't general enough to talk about hypothesizing the truth of propositions
	 in the <I>middle</I> of a sequence of world-transitions.

	 <h2>Introducing Mixed Contexts</h2>

	 We want to allow for a mixture of truth-assumptions and
	 action-transitions, so the left side of our sequents should look
	 like \[\Delta ::= \cdot \celse \Delta, \phi\rtrue \celse \Delta,
	 \alpha \ract\] We mean to impose the following structural-rule
	 discipline on such contexts: assumptions $\phi \rtrue$ satisfy
	 weakening and contraction, can be permuted amongst themselves, but
	 cannot be permuted with an $\alpha \ract$, nor can $\alpha \ract$
	 be permuted amongst themselves, or weakened in general, or
	 contracted. (I believe it's sound to do weakening for actions,
	 only on the <I>left</I> end of the context, but it's not
	 particularly obvious that this should be the case at this point in
	 the narrative) We can get away with eliding the judgment tag (the
	 $\rtrue$ or $\ract$) in almost every case because it can be
	 inferred from the type of the syntactic object.

	 <p/>
	 We can think of such a context as if it were an ordered list of
	 (internally unordered) contexts of ordinary assumptions, linked by
	 actions. \[\Gamma_0 \mapsto_{\alpha_1}\cdots \mapsto_{\alpha_n}
	 \Gamma_n\]
	 \[\approx \Gamma_0, \alpha_1 \ract, \ldots, \alpha_n \ract, \Gamma_n \]
	 where here each $\Gamma_i$ here only containing propositions $\phi \rtrue$.

	 <p/>

	 We could give the meaning of a context recursively by saying
	 \[\cdot \wat u = \top\]
	 \[(\Delta, \phi \rtrue) \wat u = \Delta \wat u \land \phi \wat u\]
	 \[(\Delta, \alpha \ract) \wat v = \exists u . R_\alpha(u, v) \land  \Delta \wat u\]
	 and that the intended meaning of $\Delta \prov \phi$ is
	 \[\forall u . \Delta \wat u \imp \phi \wat u\]
	 but we will actually want a slightly more general notion.
	 For any worlds $u, v$, we define
	 $\Delta(u, v)$ to be a metalanguage proposition, defined recursively by
	 \[\cdot(u, v)  = (u = v) \]
	 \[(\Delta, \phi \rtrue)(u, v)  = \Delta(u, v) \land \phi\wat v \]
	 \[(\Delta, \alpha \ract)(u, v)  = \exists w .  \Delta(u, w) \land R_\alpha(w, v)  \]
	 and observe that the previous definition falls out as a special case of this, since
	 \[\Delta \wat u \equiv \exists v . \Delta(v, u)\]
	 This means another way of expressing the semantics of a sequent $\Delta \prov \phi$ is
	 \[\forall u v . \Delta(v, u) \imp \phi \wat u\]
	 <h2> Action Left Rules</h2>
	 Now we can say
	 \[
	  \Delta, \alpha, \beta, \Delta' \prov \phi
	 \over
	  \Delta, \alpha \cdot \beta, \Delta' \prov \phi
	 \]

	 \[
{	  \Delta, \Delta' \prov \phi
	 \over
	  \Delta, 1, \Delta' \prov \phi}
	 \qquad
	{ \over
	  \Delta, 0, \Delta' \prov \phi}
	 \]

	 \[
	  \Delta, \alpha, \Delta' \prov \phi \qquad
	  \Delta,  \beta, \Delta' \prov \phi
	 \over
	  \Delta, \alpha \cup \beta, \Delta' \prov \phi
	 \]

	 \[
	  \Delta, \alpha, \Delta' \prov \phi \qquad
	  \Delta,  \beta, \Delta' \prov \phi
	 \over
	  \Delta, \alpha \cup \beta, \Delta' \prov \phi
	 \]
and what's new is that we can say
	 \[
	  \Delta,  \phi, \Delta' \prov \psi
	 \over
	  \Delta, ?\phi, \Delta' \prov \psi
	 \]

	 <h2>Rules for the modality</h2>
	 We've set things up so that the right rule for $[\alpha]\phi$ is easy:
	 \[
	 \Delta \prov [\alpha]\phi
	 \over
	 \Delta, \alpha \prov \phi
	 \]
	 Both the premise and conclusion of this rule have the same semantics, namely
	 \[\forall u v . \Delta \wat u \imp R_\alpha(u, v) \imp \phi \wat v \]
	 Let's look at how the left rule plays out, though; Most likely it will require us to invent
	 a new judgmental form for what happens to actions on the right, namely in right focus.
	 Let's think about a sequent that's shaped like
	 \[\Delta, \alpha, \Gamma, [\beta]\phi, \Gamma', \alpha', \Delta' \prov \psi \]
	 What I've done is assumed that the context has a $[\beta]\psi$ in it somewhere in the middle,
	 and identified the nearest actions $\alpha$ and $\alpha'$ to its left and right,
	 with $\Gamma$ and $\Gamma'$ being the intervening groups of purely $\rtrue$ assumptions.
	 The meaning of this sequent is something of the shape
	 \[\forall \cdots u, v, w \cdots u_\infty. (\cdots \land R_\alpha(u, v) \land
(\Gamma \wat v) \land ([\beta]\phi \wat v) \land (\Gamma' \wat v) \land R_{\alpha'}(v, w) \land \cdots) \imp \psi \wat u_\infty \]
	 so when we left-focus  on $[\beta]\phi \wat v$, that is, focus on $\forall v' . R_\beta(v, v') \imp \phi \wat v'$.
	 This means we have to make a choice of future world $v'$, and also prove that $v'$ really is $\beta$-accessible
	 from $v$. Let's make up some notation for this by saying that the left rule for $[\alpha]\phi$ is
	 \[
	 \Delta_1/\Delta_2/\Delta_3\prov \alpha \qquad \Delta_1, \Delta_2 ,\phi, \Delta_3 \prov \psi
	 \over
	 \Delta_1, [\alpha]\phi, \Delta_2, \Delta_3 \prov \psi
	 \]
	 Now we have to define the judgment
	 \[\Delta_1/\Delta_2/\Delta_3 \prov \alpha\]
	 whose informal meaning is that we can transition from the current world of the first slash,
	 to the current world of the second slash, via action $\alpha$.

	 We define the meaning of $\Delta_1/\Delta_2/\Delta_3 \prov \alpha$
	 to be
	 \[\forall u,v,w,z . \Delta_1(u, v) \land \Delta_2(v, w) \land \Delta_3(w, z) \imp R_\alpha(v, w)\]

	 <h2>An Exchange Law for this Judgment</h2>
	 Armed with that definition, we can tell that we can allow exchange across slashes for propositional
	 hypotheses (although not actions), i.e.
	 the structural rules
	 \[
	 {
	 \Delta_1, \phi /\Delta_2/\Delta_3 \prov \psi
	 \over
	 \Delta_1  /\phi,\Delta_2/\Delta_3 \prov \psi}
	 \qquad
	 {
	 \Delta_1  /\phi,\Delta_2/\Delta_3 \prov \psi
	 \over
	 \Delta_1, \phi /\Delta_2/\Delta_3 \prov \psi}
	 \]
 \[
	 {
	 \Delta_1 /\Delta_2, \phi/\Delta_3 \prov \psi
	 \over
	 \Delta_1  /\Delta_2/\phi,\Delta_3 \prov \psi}
	 \qquad
	 {
	 \Delta_1  /\Delta_2/\phi,\Delta_3 \prov \psi
	 \over
	 \Delta_1 /\Delta_2, \phi/\Delta_3 \prov \psi}
	 \]
	 because we can prove as a lemma that
	 \[(\phi \rtrue, \Delta)(u, v) = \phi \wat u \land \Delta(u, v)\] and therefore the semantics
	 of both the premise and conclusion of these four rules are respectively equivalent to one of
	 \[\forall u,v,w,z .\Delta_1(u, v) \land \phi(v) \land \Delta_2(v, w) \land \Delta_3(w, z) \imp R_\alpha(v, w)
	 \]
	 \[
	 \forall u,v,w,z . \Delta_1(u, v) \land \Delta_2(v, w) \land \phi(w) \land \Delta_3(w, z) \imp R_\alpha(v, w)\]
	 <h2>Action Right Rules</h2>
	 Let's now try to write down some rules that decompose $\alpha$.
	 \[
	 {\over
	 \Delta_1/\cdot /\Delta_3 \prov 1}
	 \qquad
	 \textrm{\textcolor{gray}{(no rule for 0)}}
	 \]

	 \[
	 \Delta_1/\Delta_2/\Delta_3\Delta_4 \prov \alpha
	 \qquad
	 \Delta_1\Delta_2/\Delta_3/\Delta_4 \prov \beta
	 \over
	 \Delta_1/\Delta_2\Delta_3/\Delta_4 \prov \alpha\cdot\beta
	 \]
	 \[
	 {	 \Delta_1/\Delta_2/\Delta_3 \prov \alpha
	 \over
	 \Delta_1/\Delta_2/\Delta_3 \prov \alpha\cup \beta
	 }
	 \qquad
	 {	 \Delta_1/\Delta_2/\Delta_3 \prov \beta
	 \over
	 \Delta_1/\Delta_2/\Delta_3 \prov \alpha\cup \beta
	 }	 \]
	 \[
	 {	 \Delta_1 \prov \phi
	 \over
	 \Delta_1/\cdot /\Delta_3 \prov ?\phi
	 }
	 \qquad
	 {
	 \over
	 \Delta_1/ \pi  /\Delta_3 \prov \pi
	 }	 \]
	 All of these are admissible with respect to the semantics.
	 <h2>Rules For Ordinary Connectives</h2>
	 We need to settle how regular connectives interact with this judgmental machinery.
	 An easy one to start with is the init rule, which requires that no actions appear to the right of the hypothesis
	 being concluded:
	 \[ \over \Delta, \phi \prov \phi \]
	 Rules for $\land$ and $\lor$ don't do anything surprising:
	 \[{\Delta \prov \phi  \qquad \Delta \prov \psi \over \Delta \prov \phi \land \psi}
	 \qquad
	 {\Delta, \phi, \Delta' \prov \theta \over \Delta, \phi \land \psi, \Delta' \prov \theta}
	 \qquad
	 {\Delta, \psi, \Delta' \prov \theta \over \Delta, \phi \land \psi, \Delta' \prov \theta}
	 \]
	 \[{ \Delta, \phi, \Delta' \prov \theta
	 \qquad	\Delta,  \psi, \Delta' \prov \theta
	 \over \Delta, \phi \lor \psi, \Delta' \prov \theta}
	 \qquad
	 {\Delta \prov \phi \over \Delta \prov \phi \lor \psi}
	 \qquad
	 {\Delta \prov \psi \over \Delta \prov \phi \lor \psi}
	 \]
	 but for $\imp$ we have to truncate the context to the current world in the left rule:
	 \[{\Delta \prov \phi \qquad \Delta, \psi, \Delta' \prov \theta \over \Delta, \phi \imp \psi, \Delta' \prov \theta }
	 \qquad
	 {\Delta, \phi \prov  \psi \over \Delta \prov \phi \imp \psi }\]
	 In the semantics, the left rule becomes

	 \[\forall uv.\Delta(u, v) \imp \phi \wat v
	 \qquad \forall uvw . \Delta(u, v), \psi \wat v, \Delta'(v, w) \prov \theta \wat w
	 \over \forall uvw. \Delta(u, v), (\phi \wat v) \imp (\psi \wat v), \Delta'(v, w) \prov \theta \wat w
	 \]
	 <h2>What's Missing</h2>
	 What this handles is actions that
	 can <I>test</I> the truth of propositions at various worlds, but
	 it can't <I>change</I> the truth of them, either actually really
	 changing the value of atomic propositions as in the
	 $\mathsf{flip}$
	 operation <a href="http://www.vub.ac.be/CLWF/SS/BER.pdf">as Baltag
	 has</a>, or changing them in the minds of epistemic agents. It
	 would be very interesting to see how those (or appropriate weakenings of them) might be added in a constructive/judgmental setting, but I
	 don't have any clear ideas right now.
