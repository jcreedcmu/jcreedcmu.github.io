	 Suppose we have a topological space $X$ and a continuous map $\pi$ that
	 takes $X$ to the closed real unit interval $[0,1]$.
	 <center><img src="fibration.png"></center>
	 <b>Question</b>: Let's say we allow ourselves to require some more data and axioms on this structure,
	 and quotient out by whatever equivalence relation
	 we like. Is there a nice way to do that
	 such that the resulting objects are in bijection with trees?

		A tree can be a leaf, or else it is a branching node with an unordered set of branches.

		I'm pretty confident there is a good answer to this question, and below I try to sketch out how I think it looks:
		<h2>Extra Data</h2>

		We require that all of the points in $X$ are marked as
		either <I>regular</I> (places where no branching occurs)
		or <I>singular</I> (where branching may occur, although note
		that it may be a trivial 1-ary branch). In the example
		diagrams, the regular points are colored black and the
		singular points are colored red.

		<h2>Axioms</h2>

		<ol>
		  <li>("<b>push right</b>") For any $t &lt; u \in [0,1]$, and any $x\in X$ lying in the
			 fiber over $t$ (i.e. $\pi(x) = t$) there is a <I>unique</I> map $\theta : [t,u] \to X$ such
			 that  $\theta(t) = x$ and $\pi \o \theta$ is the identity on $[t,u]$.
			 <p/>
			 Intuitively: given any point $x \in X$, there is a unique way to "push it forward in time".
			 <p/>
			 This property can also be expressed as a unique lifting property: $\pi$ is right orthogonal to the inclusion of the
			 0 endpoint of the interval $[0,1] = \I$, if we restrict our attention to <i>monotone</i> maps $\I \to \I$
			 downstairs.
			 <center><img src="property1.png"></center>
		  <li>("<b>fill left</b>") For any $t &lt; u \in [0,1]$, and any map $p : (0,1] \in X$ out of the half-open
			 interval that lies above $(t,u]$ (i.e. for any $v \in (0,1]$ we have $\pi(p(v)) = v$)
			 there is a <I>unique</I> map $\theta : [t,u] \to X$ such
			 that
			 <p/>
			 Intuitively: given any path $p : (0,1] \to X$ that's "open on the left", there is a unique way to "fill in its left endpoint".
			 <p/>
			 This property can also be expressed as a unique lifting property: $\pi$ is right orthogonal to the inclusion of the
			 half-open interval $(0,1]$ into the closed interval $[0,1] = \I$, if again we restrict our attention to <i>monotone</i>
			 maps $\I \to \I$ downstairs.
			 <center><img src="property2.png"></center>
			 <p/>
			 The point of this axiom to rule out cases where $X$ has a
			 branch that "comes into existence" (where we think of time
			 as proceeding from left to right) with no actual
			 definite zero-branch branching point that marks its creation. An
			 example of a space that <I>doesn't</I> satisfy this axiom
			 is one that has a piece that looks like an interval open
			 on the left:
			 <center><img src="property2-note.png"></center>


		  <li>("<b>regular points are locally trivial</b>")
			 For any regular point $x \in X$, there exists a neighborhood $[t,u] \subseteq \I$ of $\pi(x)$ such that
			 there is a <i>unique</I> lift $\theta : [t,u] \to X$ that lies over $[t,u]$ and has $\theta(\pi(x)) = x$,
			 and furthermore every point of the image of $\theta$ is regular.
			 <p/>
			 Intuitively, every regular point has a neighborhood in $X$ that looks like a single unbranching line.
		  <li>("<b>singular points are isolated</b>")
			 For any singular point $x \in X$, there exists a neighborhood $[t,u] \subseteq \I$ of $\pi(x)$ such that
			 for any lift $\theta : [t,u] \to X$ that lies over $[t,u]$ and has $\theta(\pi(x)) = x$,
			 the only singular point in the image of $\theta$ is $x$ itself.
			 <p/>
			 Intuitively, every singular point has a neighborhood in $X$ with no other singular points in it.
			 <center><img src="property4.png"></center>
		  <li>
			 The fiber $\pi^{-1}(1) \subseteq X$ over time $1$ is a singleton set. (We
			 could drop this axiom and instead obtain topological realizations of
			 forests instead of trees.)
		  <li>All points in the fibers over $0 \in \I$ and  $1 \in \I$ are regular.
		</ol>

		<h2>Equivalence Relation</h2>
		I haven't quite nailed down what equivalence relation I need to quotient by, but I think it's given by the existence
		of higher-dimensional cells that have similar sorts of local triviality properties as above.
		<h2>Bijection between Spaces and Trees</h2>
	 <p/>
	 <h3>Turning a Space into a Tree</h3>
	 If we're given a space over $\I$ satisfying the axioms above, here's how we compute a tree from it.
	 Consider the single point $\{*\}$ that lives over the final time 1. It's regular by definition, so there's
	 at least some nontrivial neighborhood $[t,1] \subseteq \I$ with $t &lt; 1$ such that we get unique lifts over $[t,1]$.
	 How far back can we push $t$ and still have this property?
	 <p/>
    Say $t$ is a <I>unique precedent</I> of a point $x\in X$ lying
	 over $u$ if there is a unique lift $\theta : [t,u] \to X$ over
	 $[t,u]$ with $\theta(u) = x$.
	 <p/>
	 Say $t$ is a <i>strong unique precedent</I> of $x$ over $u$ if for all $t' &ge; t$, we have that $t'$ is a unique precedent of $x$.
	 <p/>
	 Consider the set of strong unique precedents of $*$ over $1$. It's
	 closed to the right, by the universal quantifier in the definition
	 of strong unique precedent. So consider its infimum.
	 <p/>
	 By the "fill left" axiom, it must <I>attain</I> its infimum. It could be at time 0, in which case we have a leaf of the tree,
	 but otherwise it must be a <I>singular</I> point &mdash; for otherwise the local triviality of regular points would lets us
	 extend to unique precedents beyond where we supposed the infimum to be.
	 <p/>

	 So in conclusion, given any point, we can uniquely "rewind" back
	 to the most recent singular point that preceded it. Compactness of
	 the unit interval together with isolation of singular points
	 guarantees that no path has infinitely many singular points.
	 Therefore we can use transfinite induction to construct a tree out
	 of the structure of singular points and intervals of regular
	 points between them.

	 <h3>Turning a Tree into a Space</h3>

	 This is a more straightforward induction. The tree that is a
	 single leaf becomes the identity map from $[0,1]$ to itself, with all points declared regular. If we
	 have a tree that is node, use the induction hypothesis to convert
	 all of its subtrees $(t_i)_{i\in I}$ to maps $\pi_i : X_i \to [0,1]$.

	 Then take the union $\bigcup_i X_i$ of all these spaces, and identify together
	 all the points $\pi^{-1}_i(1) \in X_i$, if any. Reparameterize time by postcomposing with the map
	 \[ (\dash / 2) : [0,1] \to [0,1/2] \]
	 to obtain a map
	 \[  \bigcup_i X_i \to [0, 1/2] \]
	 Now attach the identity map $[1/2,1] \to [1/2, 1]$ to get the final projection
	 \[ \pi : \left(\left( \bigcup_i X_i\right) \cup [1/2,1]\right) \to [0,1] \]
	 Declare the single point that lies over $1/2$ (which had been regular
	 in each $X_i$, because it was on the boundary fiber over time $1$)
	 to be singular. All points strictly later than it are regular, and all points strictly
	 earlier than it came from some $X_i$ and are assigned
	 regularity/singularity according to the $X_i$ it came from.
	 Then check that all axioms are satisfied.
