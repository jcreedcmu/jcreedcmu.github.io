	 <h1>Directed Spaces vs. Categories</h1>

	 <h2>Categories</h2>

	 <a href="https://jcreedcmu.github.io/posts/2018-05-20/index.html">I
	 wrote a little before</a> about the well-known fact that the
	 category <b>Cat</b> isn't locally cartesian closed, which means
	 that naively attempting to build a (dependent) type theory where
	 "every type is a category" fails.

	 <p>We can see this directly in an example of a pushout that is not stable
		under pullback:
		<center><img src="../2018-05-20/pushpull.png"></center> When we
		take the pushout of two morphisms, $f : A \to B$ and $g : B \to
		C$, joining them at the middle object $B$, we are asking the
		question: what is the minimal category that contains the
		morphism $f$ like so, and contains the morphism $g$ like so?
		Because <I>being</I> a category requires having composites, the
		answer to that question is a category with <I>three</I>
		(nonidentity) morphisms. The third morphism, $gf$, springs
		magically into existence, once $f$ and $g$ are simultaneously
		present in a composable configuration.

	 <p>I want to focus in on <I>why</I> this "magically appearing"
		morphism is problematic for the purposes of the lccc property,
		and therefore for supporting dependent types. It's not just that
		it <I>appears</I> as a consequence of the pushout, but also
		because of what happens during the pullback.

	 <p>When we try to restrict attention to that magically-created
		morphism $gf : A \to C$ --- that is, when we take a pullback
		along the inclusion of $gf$ --- we get back so little data that
		it's no longer enough to explain where $gf$ came from. We just
		get the objects $A$ and $C$ in the northwest and southeast
		corners of the post-pullback pushout square. The morphisms $f$
		and $g$ are absent. In a sense made definite by the result of
		taking the pullback, we see that the morphisms $f$ and $g$
		that <I>cause $gf$ to exist</I> are not the material
		that <I>constitute</I> the morphism $gf$. They're separate from
		it.

		<h2>Directed Spaces</h2>

		So I want to think about situations where this is <I>not</I> the
		case: where a composite path is really <I>made up of</I> the
		parts that compose to form it. I attempt to do this by
		considering a certain category of sheaves.

	 <p>Let $\C$ be the category with one object $\U$, which is identified with the open unit interval
		$(0,1)$. The morphisms will be all strictly monotone continuous maps $(0,1) \to (0,1)$.
		\[ \C(\U,\U) = \{f : \U \to \U \st \forall x,y \in \U. x < y \imp f(x) < f(y)\}\]
																										 </p>

	 We could then think about the presheaf category $\rset^{\C^\op}$.
	 Let's define a Grothendieck topology $J$ to say which of those presheaves are sheaves: a sieve
	 $S \subseteq \C(\U,\U)$ is considered covering iff the union of
	 all the ranges of morphisms in the sieve in fact cover the unit
	 interval.

	 \[ S \in J \iff \forall y \in \U . \exists f \in S . \exists x \in \U . f(x) = y \]

	 What do sheaves for this site look like?

	 <p>A presheaf $F : \rset^{\C^\op}$ is some kind of directed space.
		The set $F(\U)$ is the set of all valid paths through the space.
		Each one of those paths can be thought of as "a permissible way
		of mapping the unit interval (0,1) into the space".
		<center><img src="diagram1.png"></center>
		The reason
		why we say $F$ is a directed space is that the monotonicity
		requirement in the definition of $\C(\U,\U)$ means there's no
		guarantee that we can reverse paths.
	 <p>
		However, we <I>do</I> know that we can at least "zoom in" on any
		path, or reparameterize it in time, by pulling back along a
		morphism $\U \to \U$.
		<center><img src="diagram2.png"></center>
		In other words: if a path is acceptable, if it goes "with the grain" of the space
		it traverses, then any subpath of that path is also acceptable.
	 <p>
		The sheaf condition provides the converse: if a path is
		acceptable everywhere locally (i.e. if a path can be cobbled
		together out of a "covering" collection of acceptable parts)
		then the path is globally acceptable. A directed space must
		have a notion of going "with the grain" that <I>is a local
		  condition</I>.

		<h2>Some Examples of Directed Spaces</h2>
		<center><img src="diagram3.png"></center>
		Here are some examples of directed spaces.
		<ol>
		  <li>$U$<p>
				The space $U$ is just the yoneda embedding of the object $\U$ of the presheaf base category.
				The set $U(\U)$ consists of all strictly monotone continuous functions $(0,1)\to (0,1)$, and the effect
				of $U$ on morphisms is simply composition.
			 <P>
				There are plenty of morphisms in the presheaf category (i.e.
				natural transformations) from $U$ to itself, one for each
				strictly monotone continuous map from $(0,1) \to (0,1)$, which we know to
				be the case by the Yoneda lemma.
		  </li>
		  <li>$V$
			 <p>
				The space $V$ is defined by setting $V(\U)$ to be the set of
				all continuous maps $(0,1) \to [0,1]$ that are strictly monotone "except at the endpoints"
				in the following sense.
			 <p>
				Say a map $f : (0,1) \to (0,1)$ is "interior strictly monotone" if for all $x,y \in \U$
				\[\forall x, y . x \le y \imp f(x) \le f(y) \]
				\[\forall x, y . f(x) = f(y) \imp (x = y \lor f(x) = 0 \lor f(x) = 1)\]
				The action of $V$ on morphisms is again simply composition.
		  </li>
		  <li>$U_0$
			 <p>
				The space $U_0$ is defined by setting $U_0(\U)$ to be the set of
				all continuous (not necessarily strictly) monotone maps $(0,1) \to (0,1)$.
				The action of $U_0$ on morphisms is given by composition.
		  </li>
		  <li>$V_0$
			 <p>
				The space $V_0$ is defined by setting $V_0(\U)$ to be the set of
				all continuous (not necessarily strictly) monotone maps $(0,1) \to [0,1]$.
				The action of $V_0$ on morphisms is given by composition.
		  </li>

		  <li>$C$
			 <p>
				The space $C$ is defined by setting $C(\U)$ to be the closed unit interval $[0,1]$.
			 <p>
				The intuition behind the above drawing of $C(\U)$ is that,
				unlike the previous directed spaces, which consist of a
				full continuum-length interval of possible "interior"
				points, the structure of $C$ consists of merely (a)
				two <I>end</I>points, (depicted as two regions of black ink) together with
				(b) a <I>single</I> transitional interior point. (depicted
				as the orange arrowhead).
			 <p>
				Each of the extended regions of black ink is to be
				understood, thinking in terms of homotopy-equivalence, as
				indistinguishable from a single point.
			 <p>
				The intended meaning of an element $x \in (0,1) \subseteq
				[0,1] = C(\U)$ is the <I>time at which</I> a probe path
				from $(0,1)$ reaches (and necessarily crosses) the single
				interior transition point. The meaning of the element $0
				\in C(\U)$ is a probe path that stays entirely inside the
				the right endpoint, the endpoint 1 of the space (i.e. the
				"transition time" was 0, it already had transitioned from
				endpoint 0 to endpoint 1) and the meaning of the element $1 \in C(\U)$
				is a probe path that stays entirely in the endpoint 0.
			 <p>
				The action of $C$ on morphisms can be defined in light of
				this intended meaning. For a map $f : (0,1) \to (0,1)$, we need
				to contravariantly give a map $C(\U) \to C(\U)$, i.e. a map $C(f) : [0,1] \to [0,1]$.
				Let $y \in [0,1]$ be given.
				<ul>
				  <li>If $y = 0$, then $C(f)(y) = 0$</li>
				  <li>If $y = 1$, then $C(f)(y) = 1$</li>
				  <li>If $\forall x . f(x) < y$, then $C(f)(y) = 1$</li>
				  <li>If $\forall x . f(x) > y$, then $C(f)(y) = 0$</li>
				  <li>If $\exists x . f(x) = y$, then $C(f)(y) = x $</li>
				</ul>
		  </li>

		  <li>$1$
			 <p>
				The space $1$ is defined by setting $1(\U)$ to be a singleton set.
				The action of $1$ on morphisms is the identity function.
		  </li>

		</ol>

		<h2> Maps Between Spaces</h2>

		There are some "obvious" maps $U \to V$ and $U_0 \to V_0$. We
		are simply including open intervals into closed intervals.
	 <p>
		Comparing $U$ to $U_0$ (and $V$ to $V_0$) is more interesting.
		The directed "texture" of the interior of $U$ is different from
		that of $U_0$. The space $U_0$ allows for paths into it that
		slow down to a complete stop, unmoving at some interior point of
		it, and then maybe resume going forward. The space $U$ does not
		--- it has a sort of minimum speed limit. To think of it another
		way: it's as if $U$ is an <I>irreflexive</I> path graph of
		infinite length, and $U_0$ is a <I>reflexive</I> path graph,
		with infinitesimal self-edge loops at every interior point.
	 <p>
		Because of this, there <I>does</I> exist a sensible inclusion
		map from $U$ to $U_0$ (and it makes sense that we'd have a graph
		homomorphism from an irreflexive graph to a reflexive one that
		is otherwise the same shape) but there is no map $U_0 \to U$.
	 <p>
		Likewise, there is a sensible inclusion $V \to V_0$, and only the two
		trivial maps $V_0 \to V$ that map all of $V_0$ to an endpoint of $V$.
	 <p>
		There are endpoint maps $1 \to V$ and $1 \to V_0$. There are no
		maps $1 \to U$. There are lots of maps $1 \to U_0$ into the
		interior of $U_0$, as well as corresponding maps $1 \to V_0$
		into the interior of $V_0$. The terminal object 1 could be
		thought of as "sitting still" and so it is acceptable to map it
		into the interior of objects like $U_0$ and $V_0$,
		and <I>un</I>acceptable to map it into the interior of objects
		like $U$ and $V$ that have a "minimum speed limit".
	 <p>
		The object $C$, as we suggested above, is structured as two
		endpoints, plus one "interior point" which imposes a direction,
		and which requires motion through it to occur only in one
		direction. We can also think of the endpoints as <I>regions that
		allow bidirectional motion</I>. So while $V$ is a reflexive
		directed path graph, $C$ is like an infinite graph
		that <I>almost everywhere</I> has edges going in both
		directions, except right in the middle of it, it has a single
		edge pointing only to the right. This means that it should be
		easy to find a canonical map $V \to C$, and harder to map $C \to
		V$.
	 <p>
		Indeed, we can construct a map $V \to C$, i.e. a map $\iota : V(\U) \to
		C(\U)$, exactly by unpacking the intuition defined in the
		definition of $C$. Given an $f : (0,1) \to [0,1] \in V(\U)$, we ask for
		which $x$ we find $f(x) = 1/2$. (there can be at most one such $x$)
		If there is such an $x$, we set $\iota(f) = x$. If the range of $f$ is always
		below $1/2$, then we set $\iota(f) = 1$, and if the range of $f$ is always greater than $1/2$,
		we set $\iota(f) = 0$.
	 <p>
		Exercise: show every map $C \to V$ factors through $1$.

		<h2>Why Is This Interesting?</h2> Even though we already know
		that sheaf categories are toposes, and therefore lccc, we can
		get a direct feel for <I>why</I> the failure of <B>Cat</B> being
		lccc doesn't happen here.
		<center><img src="diagram4.png"></center> The reason is this: if
		you consider the notion of path that the category is based on,
		composite paths <I>literally contain</I> the paths that compose
		them. There's no way of naming the path $gf$ that does not have
		$f$ and $g$ as its constituents. Therefore the pushout of $f$
		and $g$ certainly survives the pullback along the "inclusion of
		$gf$ in the pushout of $f$ and $g$", because that pullback is
		trivially along an identity morphism.

		<h2>What about Categories-as-Types?</h2>

		This whole business may seem to be solving a problem that nobody
		wanted solved. We <I>wanted</I> to have types be categories, and
		instead I'm talking about types that are directed spaces, which
		maybe <I>have</I> fundamental categories the way that
		topological spaces have fundamental groupoids, but aren't the
		same thing as categories.
	 <p>
		But I think that it actually is the case that categories include
		into directed spaces in this sense. The object $C$ described
		above is the category with two objects and one nontrivial arrow:
		there is really only one place to transition.
	 <p>
		We must be careful that pushouts in the category of
		directed spaces are not the same thing as pushouts
		in <b>Cat</b>. If I pushout two copies of $C$ joined at their
		endpoints, I get something that I might reasonably call $C_2$.

		<center><img src="diagram5.png"></center>

		The space $C_2$ has three points (i.e. maps from $1$) and two
		"directed transitions".
	 <p>
		We may notice that even though a $V$-path and a $V$-path into a
		space can always compose to give another $V$-path, so there is a
		surjection $V \to C_2$. But it's <I>not</I> the case that the
		two pushout-provided injections $C\to C_2$ "compose" to produce
		a surjective map $C \to C_2$. There are in fact only 5 different
		maps $C \to C_2$, one for every monotone map $\{0,1\} \to
		\{0,1/2,2\}$ <i>except</I> for the 'spanning' one that sends 0
		to 0 and 1 to 1. The domain $C$ doesn't have enough "stretch" to
		cover <I>two</I> transitional points, and the codomain $C_2$
		doesn't have a single-transition "shortcut" from its leftmost
		endpoint to its rightmost.

		<h2>Conjecturing a Modality</h2> So this feels very much like
		the notion of Kan completeness (i.e "being a Segal type") that
		shows up
		in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07442">Riehl-Shulman</a>.
		Not every type is a category, but some types are: those in which
		every time we find a $V$-path we can <I>also</I> find a shortcut
		$C$-path. I think this is the same thing as saying: a type $T$
		is a category if it's fibrant with respect to the inclusion $V
		\to C$ being a cofibration.

		<center><img src="diagram6.png"></center>

		So should I expect there to exist a "fibrant replacement"
		modality that adds in just enough "shortcut" morphisms to make a
		type into a category in the most conservative way?
