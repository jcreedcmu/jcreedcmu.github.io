	 <h1>Differential Geometry On Cartographic Spaces</h1>

	 <h2>Cartographic Sets</h2>
	 There's a combinatorial way of describing $n$-dimensional discrete spaces that I'm quite
	 fond of, that I've seen go by under various different names: it's very close to
	 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_polytope">Abstract Polytopes</a>, but has a more algebraic feel.
	 I've seen them called "<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.04148">Maniplexes</A>", although maybe to be
	 a maniplex is to satisfy a slightly broader set of nondegeneracy conditions. Anyway, I'm going
	 to refer to them here as "Cartographic Spaces", following Grothendieck's description of the Cartographic Group
	 in <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Esquisse+d%27un+programme">Esquisse d'un Programme</a>.
	 <p>
		Here's the definition: an ($n$-dimensional) <em>cartographic
      set</em> is an action of the cartographic
      group on some set $X$. The $n$-dimensional cartographic group is given by generators and relations
		\[ (\sigma_0, \ldots, \sigma_n \st  \sigma_i^2 = (\sigma_i\sigma_j)^2 = 1,\ (|i - j| > 1)) \]
		The intuition behind this definition is that a $n$-dimensional space is made up of cells:
		0-dimensional vertices, 1-dimensional edges, 2-dimensional faces (which, since this isn't a <em>simplicial</em>
		complex, can be generally polygons, rather than merely triangles), 3-dimensional volumes, etc.

	 <p>The elements of the set $X$ on which the group acts are not
		cells but <em>flags</em>: a flag is a choice of a 0-cell $c_0$
		and a 1-cell $c_1$, and $\cdots$ and an $n$-cell $c_n$, such
		that all the $(c_i)_{i\in \{0,\ldots,n\}}$ are incident to one
		another. For example, here is a depiction of a 2-dimensional space, (it's 2-dimensional because the space itself
		is constituted out of at most 2-dimensional stuff, though I've depicted it as a surface embedded in 3-dimensions)
		with some flags indicated by short lines attached to the face and edge
		that they belong to, drawn <em>nearer</em> to the vertex they belong to:
	 <center><img src="flags1.png"></center>
	 The 10 red flags all correspond to the top, 5-sided face, and the
	 8 blue flags all belong to the front, 4-sided face. It is more convenient to draw
	 flags as dots near their incident cells, like so:
	 <center><img src="flags2.png"></center>
	 so that we can draw the action of the group generators $\sigma_i$ on them as a graph:
	 <center><img src="flags3.png"></center>

	 The graph is undirected because we required that every $\sigma_i$
	 is an involution $\sigma_i^2 = 1$. The effect of $\sigma_i$ is an
	 "$i$-dimensional flip": when we hit a flag with $\sigma_i$, we
	 take as input some flag $(c_0, c_1, \ldots, c_i, \ldots, c_n)$, and we change it
	 to $(c_0, c_1, \ldots, c_i', \ldots, c_n)$, the unique other flag that differs
	 from the first in only its $i$-dimensional cell.
	 <p>
		The fact that non-adjacent generators are supposed to commute ($\sigma_i\sigma_j = 1$ when $|i - j| > 2$) here
		means specifically that $\sigma_0$ and $\sigma_2$ commute, so we always end up with <em>squares</em>
		of blue and green edges in the above diagram, with blue and green edges alternating around each square.

		<h2>Cartographic Spaces</h2>

		I wanted to puzzle out for myself how one should think about discrete
		differential geometry on these structures, and I think there's a
		very pleasant answer. In order to talk about flows and forms and so on, we have to generalize
		cartographic sets to cartographic linear <em>spaces</em>. This is as easy as replacing "action on a set"
		with "linear action on a linear vector space".
	 <p>
		A <em>cartographic space</em> is defined to be a vector space
		$V$ together with a homomorphism from the $n$-dimensional
		cartographic group to the group of linear maps $V \to V$.
	 <p>
		For example, if we have a cartographic set $X$, we can trivially
		define a cartographic space from it: simply let the space $V$ be
		the space of all linear combinations of elements of $X$, and let
		the action of $\sigma_i$ on $V$ be the natural extension from
		its action on basis elements to general elements of $V$.
	 <h2>$k$-Vector Fields</h2>
		We can then define what it means to be a $k$-vector field on $V$
		in a nice way: if $k \in \{0,\ldots,n\}$, we say that a $k$-vector field on $V$
		is an element $v \in V$ such that for any $i$, we have $\sigma_i v = -v$ if $i &lt; k$,
	 and $\sigma_i v = v$ if $i > k$. We can write this as a linear subspace of $V$:
	 \[ V_k = \{ v \in V \st \forall i . (i &lt; k \imp \sigma_i v = -v) \wedge (i > k \imp \sigma_i v = v)\}\]
	 \[ = \bigcap_{i &lt; k}\ker(\sigma_i + 1) \cap \bigcap_{i > k} \ker(\sigma_i - 1) \]
	 <p>
		Here is an example of a $0$-vector field on $V$, i.e. a scalar
		field on the vertices of the space. The condition above requires
		$\sigma_1 v = v$ and $\sigma_2 v = v$; flipping the edge we're
		sitting on shouldn't change the coefficient of the flag we're
		looking at, and neither should flipping the face. All that
		matters is the vertex.
	 <center><img src="flags4.png"></center>

	 Here is an example of a $1$-vector field on $V$, i.e. a collection
	 of weighted oriented edges. The condition above requires $\sigma_0 v = -v$
	 and $\sigma_2 v = v$. If we flip a vertex, we must flip the sign of the coefficient,
	 but if we flip the face, we must keep the coefficient constant.
	 <center><img src="flags5.png"></center>

	 Finally, Here is an example of a $2$-vector field on $V$, i.e. a
	 collection of weighted oriented faces. The condition above
	 requires $\sigma_0 v = -v$ and $\sigma_1 v = -v$. If we flip
	 either the vertex or edge of a flag, we must flip the sign of the
	 coefficient.

	 <h2>Computing Boundaries</h2>
	 If we are to do differential geometry, we have to have some notion that plays the role of taking the
	 boundary of a bit of space, or, dually, takes the exterior derivative of a form, bumping the dimension
	 of a field (or form) down or up by one, respectively.
	 <p>
		Curiously, I think both of these operations in this setting &mdash; at least when the cartographic space
		in question arises from a cartographic set &mdash; can be realized (when we fix the dimension $k$)
		as <i>projection</I> operators on $V$, i.e. linear idempotent maps $V \to V$.
		Given the involutivity of $\sigma_i$, we do know that $\mu_i = (\sigma_i + 1) / 2$ is idempotent,
		for
		\[ \mu_i \mu_i v = \mu_i (\sigma_i v + v) / 2 \]
		\[= (\sigma_i \sigma_i v + 2 \sigma_i v + v) / 4\]
		\[= ( v + 2 \sigma_i v + v) / 4\]
		\[= ( 2 \sigma_i v + 2v) / 4\]
		\[= ( \sigma_i v + v) / 2\]
		\[= \mu_i v\]
		We can also define the 'opposite' projection $\bar \mu_i = (1 - \sigma_i) / 2$. It is easy
		to check that $\im \mu_i = \ker \bar \mu_i$ and $\ker \mu_i = \im \bar\mu_i$ and $\mu_i + \bar\mu_i = 1$.

		Now I claim that there are projections $L_k, R_k : V \to V$, uniquely defined by requiring that
		\[\im L_k = \bigcap_{i &lt; k} \ker \mu_i \qquad \im R_k =  \bigcap_{i > k} \im \mu_i \]
		\[\ker L_k = \sum_{i &lt; k} \im \mu_i \qquad \ker R_k = \sum_{i > k} \ker \mu_i \]
		and in fact these commute, $L_k R_k = R_k L_k$. Let's define $\pi_k = L_k R_k$.
		I claim moreover that the image of $\pi_k$ is exactly the set of $k$-vector fields $V_k$, since
	 \[ V_k = \bigcap_{i &lt; k}\ker(\sigma_i + 1) \cap \bigcap_{i > k} \ker(\sigma_i - 1) \]
		\[ = \bigcap_{i &lt; k}\ker((\sigma_i + 1) / 2) \cap \bigcap_{i > k} \ker((\sigma_i - 1) / 2) \]
		\[ = \bigcap_{i &lt; k}\ker(\mu_i) \cap \bigcap_{i > k} \ker(\bar\mu_i) \]
		\[ = \bigcap_{i &lt; k}\ker(\mu_i) \cap \bigcap_{i > k} \im(\mu_i) \]
		\[ = \im L_k \cap \im R_k\]
	 <p>
		Now the punchline is that taking a $(k+1)$-vector field that already lives $V_{k+1}$ and hitting it with $\pi_k$
		is essentially the same thing as taking its boundary. In this case, if we wanted to show that
		the chain complex condition
		\[\partial \partial = 0\]
		holds, it would suffice to show that
		\[ \pi_{k-1}\pi_k\pi_{k+1} = 0 \tag{1}\]
		For we start with some vector $v$ that lives in $V_{k+1}$, and so we know that $\pi_{k+1} v = v$.
		If we take its boundary once, that's $\pi_k \pi_{k+1} v$. If we take its boundary twice, that's
		$\pi_{k-1}\pi_k \pi_{k+1}$. To establish (1), we need only check a few 'absorption' properties,
		namely that for any $k$, we have
		\[ i&lt; k \imp (L_k \bar\mu_i = L_k = \bar\mu_i L_k) \quad L_k L_{k+1} = L_{k+1} \]
		\[ i&gt; k \imp (R_k \mu_i = R_k = \mu_i R_k) \quad R_{k-1} R_{k} = R_{k-1}\]
		which means that
		\[ \pi_{k-1}\pi_k\pi_{k+1} =   L_{k-1}R_{k-1} R_k L_k L_{k+1}R_{k+1} \]
		\[ =   L_{k-1}R_{k-1}  L_{k+1}R_{k+1} \]
		\[ =   L_{k-1}R_{k-1}\mu_k  \bar\mu_k L_{k+1}R_{k+1} \]
		\[ =   L_{k-1}R_{k-1} 0 L_{k+1}R_{k+1} \]
		\[ =   0 \]
	 <p>
		I think this is really nice! The reason that a double-boundary
		(or dually, double-exterior-derivative) is always zero, is really just the fact
		that a vector field can't simultaneously be in the image of $\mu_k$ ("$k$-even", "$k$-bosonic")
		and in the image of $\bar\mu_k$ ("$k$-odd", "$k$-fermionic")
