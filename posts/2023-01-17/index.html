    <h1>Somewhat-Topology-Preserving Hex Map Reduction</h1>

    Given a tiling of the plane with hexagons, there is a way of grouping together
    groups of seven hexes, and thinking of it as its own hex tiling:
    <p>
      <center><img src="diagram1.png"></center>
    <p>
      This rotates the tiling clockwise by a small angle, but there's
      a mirror-version of this grouping which rotates
      counter-clockwise by the same angle, so we can alternate them if
      we want to iterate and preserve the orientation of the overall
      picture. (in the limit this
      yields <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2417258_Recursive_Subdivisions_of_the_Plane_Yielding_Nearly_Hexagonal_Regions">roughly
      hexagonal fractals called Gosper regions</a>)
    <p>
      If we have some information stored on the hex map like, for
      example, which cells are land and which have water, there's a
      slight annoyance that naturally arises from the fact that we're
      downsampling, which is that some connectivity information is wrecked.
    <p>
      Imagine that during downsampling we look at the center hex of each group of 7, and let
      that determine whether the hex in the smaller map is land or water:
    <p>
      <center><img src="diagram2.png"></center>
    <p>
      The snakey peninsula in the original map, which doesn't connect to the
      northwest landmass in the original map, now incorrectly does in the smaller map.
    <p>
      A common thing in board games on hex grids is to allow features that exist on the
      <b>edges</b> of hexes as well as their interior. So let's

      <ol>
        <li>Allow there to optionally be a <b>river</b> on any edge between land hexes, and
          an <b>isthmus</b> on any edge between two water hexes.
        <li> During map reduction, place a river (or isthmus) whenever
          we attempt to create adjacent land (or water) hexes in the
          small map, but observe that there is no actual land-only (or
          water-only) path between the centers of the two adjacent
          7-hex groups in the original large map that stays within the
          interiors and boundaries of the 14 hexes in the union of
          those two original groups.
      </ol>

      Here's an example:
    <p>
      <center><img src="diagram3.png"></center>
    <p>

      I think this reduction step makes good sense even when the large
      map itself has rivers and isthmuses in it, because step 2's
      notion of connectivity between 7-hex group centers can take
      advantage of rivers and isthmuses.
    <p>
      <b>Question</b>: are there any nice lemmas one can prove about
      this preserving the topology of the original map in some sense?
      Clearly it's able to delete islands and small lakes, so it can't
      preserve all topological information, but maybe you can prove that
      it will <b>only</b> delete islands and lakes, rather than merging
      two islands or two lakes.

      <h2>Maybe a Counterexample</h2>
      This example doesn't behave like I hoped it would:
    <p>
      <center><img src="diagram4.png"></center>
    <p>
      It's because I stipulated in step 2 above that the connectivity
      between two 7-hex regions has to be witnessed by a path that
      lies <i>inside those two regions</i>. If I allowed arbitrary
      paths, that would have both the disadvantage of it being
      somewhat slower to compute (but probably not too bad) and also
      that a big ocean might obliterate an isthmus that inuitively it
      shouldn't, just because one side of the isthmus is connected to
      the other allll the way around the world.
