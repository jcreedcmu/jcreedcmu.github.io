    <title>Thoughts About a Directed Interval</title>

    <h1>Thoughts About a Directed Interval</h1>

   I started wondering what happens if you try to define a directed
    interval type that only has one closed, global, describable point ---
    the final point --- and bind your own hands and say that the only
    way you can talk about the "initial point" is indirectly, via
    global sections.
    <h2>Functions as Spaces over the Interval</h2>
      Here's a picture of what I'm thinking about:
<center><img src="diagram1.png"></center>
Consider some function $f : A \to B$, for example $A = 3$ and $B = 4$
and $f$ is the map pictured. My goal is that we should be able to equivalently think of
this as a space $X$ that lies over a directed interval $\I$, via a projection map $p$.
Axiomatically, the directed
interval has one point $i_1$. I'm picturing agda code like
<pre>
postulate
    ùïÄ : Set
    i‚ÇÅ : ùïÄ
</pre>
and intuitively the interval has a single directed feature that we call a
"transition" somewhere away from $i_1$. I'm drawing it in the diagram as a tick mark with directed arrows.
The type $\I$ has no other closed points.
We think of time as having an end, but no beginning.
<p>
Now the type $X$ (over $\I$) is supposed to capture structure of $f$ as a directed type.
Over the pre-transition part of $\I$, it looks like $A$, and over the post-transition
part of $\I$, it looks like $B$.
<h2>Functions from Fibered Spaces</h2>
So here's a putative recipe for recovering the types $A, B$ and the map $f : A \to B$,
given a type $X$ a map $X \to \I$

We say $A$ is the set of global sections of the projection $p$.
<center><img src="diagram2.png"></center>
The intuition is that each global section of $p$ has to be a path through $X$ with a "transition" inside $X$ lying over the single transition in $\I$. So it uniquely picks out a blob
of $X$ to the left of a transition.
<pre>
record func : Set‚ÇÅ where
 constructor
  cfunc
 field
  A B : Set
  f : A ‚Üí B

funcOfFibered : (X : Set) (p : X ‚Üí ùïÄ) ‚Üí func
funcOfFibered X p = record { A = Œ£[ g : ùïÄ ‚Üí X ] p ‚àò g ‚â° id , ‚Ä¶ }
</pre>
Then $B$ is simply the set of points of $X$ lying in the fiber of $p$ over $i_1$.
<center><img src="diagram3.png"></center>
<pre>
funcOfFibered : (X : Set) (p : X ‚Üí ùïÄ) ‚Üí func
funcOfFibered X p = record { A = Œ£[ g : ùïÄ ‚Üí X ] p ‚àò g ‚â° id ,
                               B = Œ£[ y : X ] p y ‚â° i‚ÇÅ , ‚Ä¶ }
</pre>
Finally, the function $f : A ‚Üí B$ can be computed as the evaluation at $i_1$.
Given a $g$ such that $pg = \rid$, we can compute $g(i_1)$, and observe
that this is in the fiber of $p$ over $i_1$, because $p(g(i_1)) = (p \o g) (i_1)
= \rid(i_1) = i_1$.
<h2>Fibered Spaces from Functions</h2>
We could also go in the opposite direction. Given a function $f : A \to B$,
it seems plausible to piece together the space $X$ as a pushout.
<center><img src="diagram4.png"></center>
For each point of $A$, we add in a copy of $\I$, so $A \x \I$ is one arm of the pushout.
We also want to make sure that $B$ is included in $X$, so $B$ is the other arm.
We then want to glue the endpoint of each copy of $\I$ in $A \x \I$ to the point
of $B$ that $f$ carries it to. This means that we want to take the pushout of the
morphism $\langle id, i_1 \rangle : A \to A \x \I$ that takes each point of $A$
to the endpoint of its interval-copy, and the morphism $f : A \to B$ that takes
each point of $A$ to its image under $B$.
<p>
Subsequently we can arrive at the projection $p$ by using the pushout UMP.
The composite of the constant-$i_1$ map $i_1 : B\to \I$ with $f : A \to B$
gives us the constantly-$i_1$ map $i_1 \o f : A \to \I$, and the
map $\pi_2  \langle id, i_1 \rangle$ is also constantly-$i_1$. So we get
a unique map $p : X \to \I$ making the diagram commute.
<h2>What Can Be Proven?</h2>
Given postulated $\I : Set$ and $i_1 : \I$,
I can definitely at this point write down constructions
<pre>
funcOfFibered : (Œ£[ X : Set ] X ‚Üí ùïÄ) ‚Üí (Œ£[ A : Set ] Œ£[ B : Set ] A ‚Üí B)
fiberedOfFunc : (Œ£[ A : Set ] Œ£[ B : Set ] A ‚Üí B) ‚Üí (Œ£[ X : Set ] X ‚Üí ùïÄ)
</pre>
but I tried for a little bit and I failed to prove that either composite of them is the identity. The next best move I assume would be to take one and postulate it is an equivalence.
But is one or the other more useful to take as a primitive equivalence? Not sure what the consequences are.
<p>
I would also hope that a map $X \to \I \x \I$ would correspond to a commutative
square, but tentative thinking in that direction suggests that might not easily
follow from any of the proposed postulates above either.
