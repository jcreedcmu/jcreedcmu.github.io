    <h1>Type Manifolds</h1>

    The point of this note is to ask: are there things in type theory
    that play the same role as differentiable manifolds in analysis?
    The latter are constructed as things that locally look like $\R^n$, and we know how
    to differentiate nice (i.e. smooth) maps $\R^n \to \R$.
    <p>
      Well, in type theory, we know how to differentiate nice (i.e. polynomial functor) maps from $\rset^n \to \rset$.
      Can we do something with that intuition? Are there exotic objects that look like multiple copies of $\rset^n$
      patched together, in the same way that manifolds are like copies of $\R^n$ patched together, or how schemes are affine
      schemes patched together?
    <p>
      First I'm going to review how we can talk about manifolds, tangent spaces, etc. in some easy warm-up cases
      so that the notation is already a familiar melody when I come to talk about types.
    <h2>The Euclidean Plane</h2>
    <center><img src="plane.png"></center>
    Let $M$ be $\R^2$. Let $C$ be the set of all smooth functions $M \to \R$. Note that
    $C$ is a semiring: we can add and multiply functions $M \to \R$ pointwise.
    <p>
    We define a tangent vector $v$ at a point $m \in \R^2$ to be a <i>derivation</i>, a thing that
    eats up a scalar function $\R^2 \to \R$ and outputs a scalar, and which behaves like a directional derivative.
    That is, we have
    \[v : C \to \R\]
    and we require that $v$ is linear, (e.g. $v(f + g) = v(f) + v(g)$ for all $f,g \in C$) and satisfies a product rule, namely
    \[v(f\cdot g) = f(m) v(g) + v(f) g(m)\]
    for all $f, g \in C$.

    This product rule is a critical piece of information that captures
    what it means for $v$ to "behave like a directional derivative".
    <p>
      It turns out that any $v$ satisfying these properties is of the form
     \[f \mapsto c_1 {\partial f\over \partial x_1}(m) + c_2 {\partial f\over \partial x_2}(m)\]
      for some parameters $c_1, c_2 \in \R$, where $x_1, x_2$ are the coordinates of the plane.
      That is, every $v$ is a linear combination of directional derivatives evaluated at the point $m$.

 <h2>The 2-Sphere</h2>
    <center><img src="sphere.png"></center>
    Let $M$ be $S^2$, the 2-dimensional sphere. Let $C$ be the set of all smooth functions $M \to \R$. Again
    $C$ is a semiring.
    <p>
    We define a tangent vector $v$ at a point $m \in S^2$ to be a derivation, a map
    \[v : C \to \R\]
    and we require that is linear, and satisfies the same product rule,
    \[v(f\cdot g) = f(m) v(g) + v(f) g(m)\]
    for all $f, g \in C$.

    <p>
     Now for any point $m$, there do exist two tangent vectors $D_1, D_2$ such that every tangent vector at $m$
     is uniquely of the form
     \[f \mapsto c_1 (D_1 f) + c_2 (D_2 f) \]
      for some parameters $c_1, c_2 \in \R$, but there is no longer a
     canonical choice of $D_1, D_2$! The possible choices vary from
     point to point, and there's no globally coherent way of choosing
     a basis of the tangent space for every point on the sphere.
     <p>
       That is: the sphere is an interesting, nontrivial manifold, as opposed to just being a boring, trivial euclidean manifold like the plane is.

       <h2>Type Manifolds</h2>
       Let $M$ be some type. Notice that $M \to \rset$ is a semiring: we have $0, 1, {+}, {\x}$ for types, and they satisfy
       all the axioms we expect them to. So let $C$ be some subsemiring of $M \to \rset$, the maps that we consider
       "smooth" or otherwise "nice".
     <p>
       We define a tangent vector $v$ at a point $m \in M$ to be a derivation, a map
       \[v : C \to \rset\]
       such that $v$ is linear, and it satisfies
       \[v(f\x g) \cong f(m) \x v(g) + v(f) \x g(m)\]
       for any $f, g \in C$, and
       \[v(f) = 0\]
       if there exists $K : \rset$ such that $f(m') = K$ for all $m' \in M$, i.e. the derivative
       of a constant function must be zero.
     <p>
       Let's take a moment to confirm that these requirements actually make sense.
       Both $C$ and $\rset$ are semirings, so $v$ being linear is a sensible thing to ask for.
       The argument $f\x g$ of $v$ is sensible: we take product types pointwise, for $f$ and $g$ being "nice"
       functions in $C \subseteq M \to \rset$. Since $C$ is a subsemiring, it's still the case that $f \x g$ is
       in $C$, so we can apply $v$ to it, yielding a type. This type is required to be isomorphic to
       the sum of two product types $f(m) \x v(g) + v(f) \x g(m)$.
       <h2>The $n$-dimensional Euclidean Type Manifold</h2>

       We can construct a simple example where the differential
       structure is globally uniform, which is the type-theoretic
       analogue of the $n$-dimensional Euclidean space. Choose $n$,
       and set:
       <ul>
         <li>$M = \N^n$
         <li>$C = $ the set of formal polynomials in $n$ variables $x_1, \ldots, x_n$ with nonnegative integer coefficients.
         <li>To construe $C$ as a subsemiring of $M \to \rset$, we say that evaluation of
           an element $f \in C$ at an argument $(m_1, \ldots, m_n) \in M$ works by
           substitution of $m_1$ for $x_1$, $m_2$ for $x_2$, $\ldots$ etc. and interpreting the result as a type.
           For example, if $n=3$, and we consider $f = x_3^4 + 2x_2 \in C$ and $m = (9,13,2) \in M$,
           then the function application $f(m)$ evaluates to the type $2^4 + 2\cdot 13 = 42$.
       </ul>
       In this case for each $i \in 1,\ldots,n$ and every point $m \in M$, there is a tangent vector $D_{m,i}$ at $m$,
       which arises from the fact that there is an operation $(\partial/\partial x_i) : C \to C$ which formally
       differentiates a polynomial in $C$ with respect to the variable $x_i$. We define:
       \[D_{m,i} : C \to \rset \]
       \[D_{m,i} (f) = ((\partial/\partial x_i) f)(m)\]
       We can observe that $D$ is linear and has the product property, directly because $\partial/\partial x_i$ has these properties:
       We see that
       \[D_{m,i} (f + g) = ((\partial/\partial x_i) (f + g))(m)\]
       \[= ((\partial/\partial x_i) f)(m) + ((\partial/\partial x_i) g)(m)\]
       \[= D_{m,i} (f) + D_{m,i} (g) \]
and
       \[D_{m,i} (f \x g) = ((\partial/\partial x_i) (f \x g))(m)\]
       \[= (g \x (\partial/\partial x_i) f )(m)  + (f \x (\partial/\partial x_i) g)(m)\]
       \[= ((\partial/\partial x_i) f)(m) \x g(m) + ((\partial/\partial x_i) g)(m) \x f(m)\]
       \[= D_{m,i} (f) \x g(m) + D_{m,i} (g) \x f(m)\]

Furthermore we can prove that these tangent vectors form a basis of every tangent space of $M$:

     <p><b>Lemma</b>: <em> For any $m\in M$, if $v$ is a tangent vector at $m$, then there exist
         coefficients $c_1, \ldots, c_n : \rset$ such that
\[v = \sum_{i=1}^n c_i D_{m,i}\]
       </em><br>
       <b>Proof</b>: Set $c_i = v(x_i)$. To show two tangent vectors $v, w$ are equal, it suffices
       to show $v(0) = w(0)$, $v(1) = w(1)$, $v(x_i) = w(x_i)$ for all $i$, and that equality is preserved under
       sums and products. We proceed to prove the required isomorphism by resorting to these cases:
       <ul>
         <li>Goal: $v(0) = \sum_{i=1}^n c_i D_{m,i}(0)$
           Easy because both sides are zero.
         <li>Goal: $v(1) = \sum_{i=1}^n c_i D_{m,i}(1)$
           Easy because both sides are zero.
         <li>Goal: $v(x_j) = \sum_{i=1}^n c_i D_{m,i}(x_j)$
           Compute:
           \[ v(x_j) = c_j = \sum_{i=1}^n c_i D_{m,i}(x_j) \]
         <li> Goal: $v(f + g) = \sum_{i=1}^n c_i D_{m,i}(f + g)$. Assume by induction hypothesis
           that
           \[v(f) = \sum_{i=1}^n c_i D_{m,i}(f)\]
           \[v(g) = \sum_{i=1}^n c_i D_{m,i}(g)\]
           Then compute:
           \[v(f + g) = v(f) + v(g)\]
           \[ =\left(\sum_{i=1}^n c_i D_{m,i}(f)\right) + \left(\sum_{i=1}^n c_i D_{m,i}(g)\right)\]
           \[= \sum_{i=1}^n c_i D_{m,i}(f + g)\]
         <li> Goal: $v(f \x g) = \sum_{i=1}^n c_i D_{m,i}(f \x g)$. Assume by induction hypothesis
           that
           \[v(f) = \sum_{i=1}^n c_i D_{m,i}(f)\]
           \[v(g) = \sum_{i=1}^n c_i D_{m,i}(g)\]
           Then compute:
           \[v(f \x g) = v(f) \x g(m) + v(g) \x f(m) \]
           \[ =\left(\sum_{i=1}^n c_i D_{m,i}(f) \x g(m)\right) + \left(\sum_{i=1}^n c_i D_{m,i}(g) \x f(m)\right)\]
           \[= \sum_{i=1}^n c_i (D_{m,i}(f) \x g(m) + D_{m,i}(g) \x f(m))\]
           \[= \sum_{i=1}^n c_i D_{m,i}(f \x g)\]
       </ul>

       <h2>Nontrivial Type Manifolds</h2>

       <blockquote>
         <b>Question</b>: We've defined a trivial type manifold, but are there interesting nontrivial examples?
       </blockquote>

       I suspect that if these exist, they might be constructed by gluing together copies of $\N^n$ as above, but I
       haven't been able to make a construction work yet. I'd be really interested if you could get something working
       where $M = \Z^n$, or with the carrier being some kind of one-dimensional circle that loops back on itself somehow.
