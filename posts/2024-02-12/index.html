    <h1>What Type is a Deck of Cards?</h1>

    Consider a standard deck $D_\mathsf{French}$ of French-suited playing cards.  It has 52 cards.
    <canvas id = "diagram1"></canvas>

    Or, if we include the jokers, we can talk about the extended deck $D^+_\mathsf{French}$, containing 54 cards.
    <canvas id = "diagram2"></canvas>

    We could also consider the <A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rider%E2%80%93Waite_Tarot">Rider-Waite Tarot Deck</a>
    It has 22 "major arcana" cards, and the "minor arcana" resembles the standard playing cards somewhat, albeit with
    different suits.
    <canvas id = "diagram3"></canvas>
    I'm sweeping under the rug a tremendous amount of historical variations of these sets. The idea I want to focus
    on is
    <h2>Decks of Cards are Finite Types</h2>
    On the one hand, this is obvious. A deck of cards is a finite collection of things. Any finite
    type is, up to isomorphism, determined by its cardinality. But the interesting things about how
    people <em>think</em> about a given card deck design are obscured by thinking about it up to isomorphism.
    So instead think a little more intensionally: let's consider what type-theoretic operations are used to
    build up a deck of cards.

    <p>
      For the standard french-suited 52-card deck, it is clear that we arrive at it by taking the <b>product type</b> of two
      types, the 13-element type of <b>ranks</b>, and the 4-element type of <b>suits</b>.
\[\mathsf{Rank}_\mathsf{French} = \{A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2\}\]
\[\mathsf{Suit}_\mathsf{French}  = \{\heartsuit, \diamondsuit, \clubsuit, \spadesuit\}\]
      \[ D_\mathsf{French} = \mathsf{Rank}_\mathsf{French} \x \mathsf{Suit}_\mathsf{French}\]

      If we introduce a 2-element type of jokers,
      \[J = \{ \mathsf{RedJoker}, \mathsf{BlackJoker} \}\]
      then we can explain the extended deck as a <b>sum type</b>.
      \[ D^+_\mathsf{French} = (\mathsf{Rank}_\mathsf{French} \x \mathsf{Suit}_\mathsf{French}) + J\]
      The Rider-Waite Tarot is also a combination of sums and products.
\[\mathsf{Rank}_\mathsf{Tarot} = \{ K, Q, N, P, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, A\}\]
\[\mathsf{Suit}_\mathsf{Tarot}  = \{\mathsf{Pentacle}, \mathsf{Cup}, \mathsf{Wand}, \mathsf{Sword}\}\]
\[\mathsf{MinorArcana}_\mathsf{Tarot}  = \mathsf{Rank}_\mathsf{Tarot} \x \mathsf{Suit}_\mathsf{Tarot}\]
\[\mathsf{MajorArcana}_\mathsf{Tarot}  = \{0, I, II, III, \ldots, XIX, XX, XXI\}\]
\[D_\mathsf{Tarot}  = \mathsf{MinorArcana}_\mathsf{Tarot} + \mathsf{MajorArcana}_\mathsf{Tarot}\]
<h2>Other Type Constructors</h2>
The reader may object that this is barely interesting at all. That is exactly my point! I intend to draw attention
to the triviality of the type structure of these decks in order to ask:
<blockquote style="background-color: #fed; padding: 1em;">
What else could we be doing instead? What other type could a deck of cards have?
</blockquote>
<h3>Function Types</h3>
Imagine we had suits $S = \{\mathsf{Red}, \mathsf{Green}, \mathsf{Blue}\}$ and quantities
$Q = \{0,1,2\}$, and made a deck of cards whose type was $S \to Q$. This would mean something like:
    <canvas id = "diagram4"></canvas>

<h3>Dependent Product Types</h3>
The card game <A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(card_game)">Set</A> has
a structure that could be thought of as a dependent product type.
Say
\[ \mathsf{Attribute} = \{ \mathsf{Color}, \mathsf{Number}, \mathsf{Shape}, \mathsf{Shading} \}\]
\[ \mathsf{Values} : \mathsf{Attribute} \to \mathsf{Type}\]
\[ \mathsf{Values}(\mathsf{Color}) = \{\mathsf{Red}, \mathsf{Green}, \mathsf{Blue}\}  \]
\[ \mathsf{Values}(\mathsf{Number}) =\{\mathsf{1}, \mathsf{2}, \mathsf{3}\}  \]
\[ \mathsf{Values}(\mathsf{Shape}) =\{\mathsf{Round}, \mathsf{Diamond}, \mathsf{Squiggly}\}  \]
\[ \mathsf{Values}(\mathsf{Shading}) =\{\mathsf{Solid}, \mathsf{Shaded}, \mathsf{Hollow}\} \]
and then type of the deck of Set cards is the type
\[ \prod_{\alpha \in \mathsf{Attribute}} \mathsf{Values}(\alpha) \]

<h3>Dependent Sum Types and Multinomial Types</h3>
<a href="https://www.decktet.com/download/decktet-rules.pdf">Decktet</a> has cards with varying numbers of suits per card.
<p>
One idea that might work for the specifically the multi-suited ranked cards in Decktet is to set
\[\mathsf{Suit} = \{\mathsf{Moon}, \mathsf{Sun}, \mathsf{Wave}, \mathsf{Leaf}, \mathsf{Wyrm}, \mathsf{Knot}\}\]
\[\mathsf{Rank} = \{2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\}\]
and then specify exactly the function
\[\delta : \mathsf{Rank} \to {\mathsf{Suit} \choose 2,2,2}\]
which maps each rank to which partition of 6 into three pairs it corresponds to.
<p>
The codomain --- written to suggest the multinomial coefficient --- is meant to be
the set of partitions of the set of suits into three pairs.
We could express this by postulating a function
\[ \mathsf{Part} : {\mathsf{Suit} \choose 2,2,2} \to \mathsf{Type} \]
that for each partition $p$ gives the (three-element) type $\mathsf{Part}(p)$ of parts of $p$, and
\[ \_{\in}\_ : \textcolor{gray}{ \prod_{p : {\mathsf{Suit} \choose 2,2,2}} }  \mathsf{Suit}\x \mathsf{Part}(p)  \to \mathsf{Type} \]
which, given a partition $p$, (implicitly omitted in applications of $\in$) a suit $\sigma$, and a part $q$ of $p$, yields a type
$\sigma \in q$ that has exactly one inhabitant iff indeed $\sigma$ is in $q$, and is empty otherwise.
<p>
Given all this machinery, the type of ranked cards in Decktet could be said to be
\[\sum_{r \in \mathsf{Rank}}  \sum_{q \in \mathsf{Part}(\delta(r))} \sum_{\sigma \in \mathsf{Suit}} \sigma \in q \]
<h3>Types with Other Algebraic Structure</h3>
Arguably it is already the case that we understand
\[\mathsf{Rank}_\mathsf{French} = \{A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2\}\]
to come equipped with a total order
\[A \ge K \ge Q \ge J \ge 10 \ge 9 \ge 8 \ge 7 \ge 6 \ge 5 \ge 4 \ge 3 \ge 2\]
or, perhaps, depending on the game being played, an alternative order such as
\[ K \ge Q \ge J \ge 10 \ge 9 \ge 8 \ge 7 \ge 6 \ge 5 \ge 4 \ge 3 \ge 2 \ge A\]
But why stop at total orders? Would it be interesting to have a type that comes with:
<ul>
<li>a monoid structure?
<li>a group structure?
<li>a partial equivalence relation?
<li>a boolean algebra?
<li>a topology?
<li>a set of morphims forming a category?
</ul>
<h3>Inductive Datatypes</h3>

What might it mean for a deck of cards to be labelled by lists, abstract syntax trees, monadic expressions?
